9,THREEPIO,Wait a minute where are you going?,IV
10,IMPERIAL,OFFICER The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.,IV
11,VADER,Where are those transmissions you intercepted?,IV
12,REBEL,OFFICER We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.,IV
13,VADER,If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?,IV
14,VADER,Commander tear this ship apart until youve found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.  I want her alive!,IV
15,TROOPER,There she is! Set for stun!,IV
16,TROOPER,Shell be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.,IV
17,THREEPIO,Hey youre not permitted in there.  Its restricted. Youll be deactivated for sure..,IV
18,THREEPIO,Dont call me a mindless philosopher you overweight glob of grease!  Now come out before somebody sees you.,IV
19,THREEPIO,Secret mission?  What plans?  What are you talking about?  Im not getting in there!,IV
20,THREEPIO,Im going to regret this.,IV
21,CHIEF,PILOT There goes another one.,IV
22,CAPTAIN,Hold your fire.  There are no life forms.  It must have been short-circuited.,IV
23,THREEPIO,Thats funny the damage doesnt look as bad from out here.,IV
24,THREEPIO,Are you sure this things safe?,IV
25,WOMAN,Ive told you kids to slow down!,IV
26,FIXER,Did I hear a young noise blast through here?,IV
27,CAMIE,It was just Wormie on another rampage.,IV
28,LUKE,Shape it up you guys!...  Biggs?,IV
29,LUKE,I didnt know you were back!  When did you get in?,IV
30,BIGGS,Just now.  I wanted to surprise you hot shot.  I thought youd be here... certainly didnt expect you to be out working. ,IV
31,LUKE,The Academy didnt change you much... but youre back so soon?  Hey what happened didnt you get your commission?,IV
32,BIGGS,Of course I got it.  Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.  First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.,IV
33,LUKE,I almost forgot.  Theres a battle going on!  Right here in our system.  Come and look!,IV
34,DEAK,Not again!  Forget it.,IV
35,LUKE,There they are!,IV
36,BIGGS,Thats no battle hot shot... theyre just sitting there!  Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.,IV
37,LUKE,But there was a lot of firing earlier...,IV
38,LUKE,Hey easy with those...,IV
39,CAMIE,Dont worry about it Wormie.,IV
40,FIXER,I keep telling you the Rebellion is a long way from here.  I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system.  Believe me Luke this planet is a big hunk of nothing...,IV
41,LEIA,Lord Vader I should have known.  Only you could be so bold.  The Imperial Senate will not sit stillfor this when they hear youve attacked a diplomatic...,IV
42,VADER,Dont play games with me Your Highness.  You werent on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.,IV
43,LEIA,I dont know what youre talking about.  Im a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...,IV
44,VADER,Youre a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.  Take her away!,IV
45,COMMANDER,Holding her is dangerous.  If word of this gets out it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.,IV
46,VADER,I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!,IV
47,COMMANDER,you anything.,IV
48,VADER,Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!,IV
49,SECOND,OFFICER Lord Vader the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting but no life forms were aboard.,IV
50,VADER,She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally Commander.  Therell be no one to stop us this time.,IV
51,COMMANDER,Yes sir.,IV
52,THREEPIO,How did I get into this mess?  I really dont know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  Its our lot in life.,IV
53,THREEPIO,Ive got to rest before I fall apart.  My joints are almost frozen. ,IV
54,THREEPIO,What a desolate place this is.,IV
55,THREEPIO,Where are you going?,IV
56,THREEPIO,Well Im not going that way.  Its much too rocky.  This way is much easier.,IV
57,THREEPIO,What makes you think there are settlements over there?,IV
58,THREEPIO,Dont get technical with me.,IV
59,THREEPIO,What mission?  What are you talking about?  Ive had just about enough of you!  Go that way!  Youll be malfunctioning within a day you nearsighted scrap pile!,IV
60,THREEPIO,And dont let me catch you following me begging for help because you wont get it.,IV
61,THREEPIO,No more adventures.  Im not going that way.,IV
62,THREEPIO,That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way but hell do no better.,IV
63,THREEPIO,Wait whats that?  A transport!  Im saved!,IV
64,THREEPIO,Over here!  Help!  Please help!,IV
65,LUKE,... so I cut off my power shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deaks trail.  I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic.,IV
66,BIGGS,You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up and one day whammo youre going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.,IV
67,LUKE,Look whos talking.  Now that youve been around those giant starships youre beginning to sound like my uncle. Youve gotten soft in the city...,IV
68,BIGGS,Ive missed you kid.,IV
69,LUKE,Well things havent been the same since you left Biggs.  Its been so...quiet.,IV
70,BIGGS,Luke I didnt come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldnt tell you this but youre the only one I can trust... and if I dont come back I want somebody to know.,IV
71,LUKE,What are you talking about?,IV
72,BIGGS,I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems were going to jump ship and join the Alliance...,IV
73,LUKE,Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?,IV
74,BIGGS,Quiet down will ya!  You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!,IV
75,LUKE,Im sorry.  Im quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...,IV
76,BIGGS,My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.,IV
77,LUKE,around forever trying to find them.,IV
78,BIGGS,I know its a long shot but if I dont find them Ill do what I can on my own...  Its what we always talked about.  Luke Im not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in. ,IV
79,LUKE,And Im stuck here...,IV
80,BIGGS,I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  Youll get your chance to get off this rock.,IV
81,LUKE,Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... theyve even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.,IV
82,BIGGS,Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.,IV
83,LUKE,I know but hes got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season.  I cant leave him now.,IV
84,BIGGS,I feel for you Luke youre going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.  What good is all your uncles work if its taken over by the Empire?...  You know theyre starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it wont be long before your uncle is merely a tenant slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.,IV
85,LUKE,It couldnt happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire wont bother with this rock.,IV
86,BIGGS,Things always change.,IV
87,LUKE,I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long? ,IV
88,BIGGS,No Im leaving in the morning...,IV
89,LUKE,Then I guess I wont see you.,IV
90,BIGGS,Maybe someday...  Ill keep a lookout.,IV
91,LUKE,Well Ill be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I wont be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet thats for sure...  Take care of yourself youll always be the best friend Ive got.,IV
92,BIGGS,So long Luke.,IV
93,THREEPIO,Artoo-Detoo!  Its you!  Its you!,IV
94,FIRST,TROOPER Someone was in the pod.  The tracks go off in this direction. ,IV
95,SECOND,TROOPER Look sir - droids.,IV
96,THREEPIO,Wake up!  Wake up!,IV
97,THREEPIO,Were doomed.,IV
98,THREEPIO,Do you think theyll melt us down?,IV
99,THREEPIO,Dont shoot!  Dont shoot!  Will this never end?,IV
100,BERU,Luke tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.,IV
101,LUKE,It looks like we dont have much of a choice but Ill remind him.,IV
102,OWEN,I have no need for a protocol droid.,IV
103,THREEPIO,Sir - not in an environment such as this - thats why Ive also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...,IV
104,OWEN,What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.,IV
105,THREEPIO,Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...,IV
106,OWEN,Do you speak Bocce?,IV
107,THREEPIO,Of course I can sir.  Its like a second language for me...  Im as fluent in Bocce...,IV
108,OWEN,All right; shut up! Ill take this one.,IV
109,THREEPIO,Shutting up sir.,IV
110,OWEN,Luke take these two over to the garage will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.,IV
111,LUKE,But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...,IV
112,OWEN,You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now come on get to it!,IV
113,LUKE,All right come on!  And the red one come on.  Well come on Red lets go.,IV
114,LUKE,Uncle Owen...,IV
115,OWEN,Yeah?,IV
116,LUKE,This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look!,IV
117,OWEN,Hey whatre you trying to push on us?,IV
118,THREEPIO,Excuse me sir but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.,IV
119,LUKE,Uncle Owen...,IV
120,OWEN,Yeah?,IV
121,LUKE,What about that one?,IV
122,OWEN,What about that blue one?  Well take that one.,IV
123,LUKE,Yeah take it away.,IV
124,THREEPIO,Uh Im quite sure youll be very pleased with that one sir.  He really is in first-class condition.  Ive worked with him before.  Here he comes.,IV
125,LUKE,Okay lets go.,IV
126,THREEPIO,Now dont forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!,IV
127,THREEPIO,Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  Ive got such a bad case of dust contamination I can barely move!,IV
128,LUKE,It just isnt fair.  Oh Biggs is right.  Im never gonna get out of here!,IV
129,THREEPIO,Is there anything I might do to help? ,IV
130,LUKE,Well not unless you can alter time speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock!,IV
131,THREEPIO,I dont think so sir.  Im only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet anyways.  As a matter of fact Im not even sure which planet Im on.,IV
132,LUKE,Well if theres a bright center to the universe youre on the planet that its farthest from.,IV
133,THREEPIO,I see sir.,IV
134,LUKE,Uh you can call me Luke.,IV
135,THREEPIO,I see sir Luke.,IV
136,LUKE,Just Luke.,IV
137,THREEPIO,And I am See-Threepio human-cyborg relations and this is my counterpart Artoo-Detoo.,IV
138,LUKE,Hello.,IV
139,LUKE,You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.,IV
140,THREEPIO,With all weve been through sometimes Im amazed were in as good condition as we are what with the Rebellion and all.,IV
141,LUKE,You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?,IV
142,THREEPIO,Thats how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning sir.,IV
143,LUKE,Have you been in many battles?,IV
144,THREEPIO,Several I think.  Actually theres not much to tell.  Im not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories.  Well not at making them interesting anyways.,IV
145,LUKE,Well my little friend youve got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...,IV
146,LEIA,Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Youremy only hope.,IV
147,LUKE,Whats this?,IV
148,THREEPIO,What is what?!?  He asked you a question...What is that?,IV
149,LEIA,Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Youre my only hope.  Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Youre my only hope.,IV
150,THREEPIO,Oh he says its nothing sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind.,IV
151,LUKE,Who is she?  Shes beautiful.,IV
152,THREEPIO,Im afraid Im not quite sure sir.,IV
153,LEIA,Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi...,IV
154,THREEPIO,I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...,IV
155,LUKE,Is there more to this recording?,IV
156,THREEPIO,Behave yourself Artoo.  Youre going to get us in trouble.  Its all right you can trust him.  Hes our new master.,IV
157,THREEPIO,He says hes the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi a resident of these parts.  And its a private message for him.  Quite frankly sir I dont know what hes talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles but with what weve been through this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.,IV
158,LUKE,Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?,IV
159,THREEPIO,I beg your pardon sir but do you know what hes talking about?,IV
160,LUKE,Well I dont know anyone named Obi-Wan but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  Hes kind of a strange old hermit.,IV
161,LUKE,I wonder who she is.  It sounds like shes in trouble.  Id better play back the whole thing.,IV
162,THREEPIO,He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt he might be able to play back the entire recording.,IV
163,LUKE,Hm?  Oh yeah well I guess youre too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay.,IV
164,LUKE,There you go.,IV
165,LUKE,Well wait a minute.  Whered she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.,IV
166,THREEPIO,been playing.  The one youre carrying inside your rusty innards! ,IV
167,AUNT,BERU Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!,IV
168,LUKE,All right Ill be right there Aunt Beru.,IV
169,THREEPIO,Im sorry sir but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.,IV
170,LUKE,Well see what you can do with him.  Ill be right back.,IV
171,THREEPIO,Just you reconsider playing that message for him.,IV
172,THREEPIO,No I dont think he likes you at all.,IV
173,THREEPIO,No I dont like you either.,IV
174,LUKE,You know I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.,IV
175,OWEN,What makes you think that?,IV
176,LUKE,Well I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.,IV
177,LUKE,I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what hes talking about?  Well I wonder if hes related to Ben.,IV
178,OWEN,That old mans just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  Thatll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.,IV
179,LUKE,But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?,IV
180,OWEN,He wont I dont think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.,IV
181,LUKE,He knew my father?,IV
182,OWEN,I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.,IV
183,LUKE,Yes sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact I uh was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.,IV
184,OWEN,You mean the next semester before harvest?,IV
185,LUKE,Sure therere more than enough droids.,IV
186,OWEN,Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season.  This year well make enough on the harvest so Ill be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year.,IV
187,OWEN,You must understand I need you here Luke.,IV
188,LUKE,But its a whole nother year.,IV
189,OWEN,Look its only one more season.,IV
190,LUKE,Yeah thats what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.,IV
191,AUNT,BERU Where are you going?,IV
192,LUKE,It looks like Im going nowhere.  I have to finish cleaning those droids.,IV
193,AUNT,BERU Owen he cant stay here forever.  Most of his friends have gone.  It means so much to him.,IV
194,OWEN,Ill make it up to him next year.  I promise.,IV
195,AUNT,BERU Lukes just not a farmer Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.,IV
196,OWEN,Thats what Im afraid of.,IV
197,LUKE,What are you doing hiding there?,IV
198,THREEPIO,It wasnt my fault sir.  Please dont deactivate me.  I told him not to go but hes faulty malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.,IV
199,LUKE,Oh no!,IV
200,THREEPIO,That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I cant understand their logic at times. ,IV
201,LUKE,How could I be so stupid?  Hes nowhere in sight.  Blast it!,IV
202,THREEPIO,Pardon me sir but couldnt we go after him?,IV
203,LUKE,Its too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  Well have to wait until morning.,IV
204,OWEN,Luke Im shutting the power down for the night.,IV
205,LUKE,All right Ill be there in a few minutes.  Boy am I gonna get it.,IV
206,LUKE,You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.,IV
207,THREEPIO,Oh he excels at that sir.,IV
208,OWEN,Luke?  Luke?  Luke?  Where could he be loafing now!,IV
209,OWEN,Have you seen Luke this morning?,IV
210,AUNT,BERU He said he had some things to do before he started today so he left early.,IV
211,OWEN,Uh?  Did he take those two new droids with him?,IV
212,AUNT,BERU I think so.,IV
213,OWEN,Well hed better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or therell be hell to pay!,IV
214,LUKE,Hows that.,IV
215,LUKE,Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere but I dont see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isnt going to take this very well.,IV
216,THREEPIO,Sir would it help if you told him it was my fault.,IV
217,LUKE,Sure.  He needs you.  Hed probably only deactivate you for a day or so...,IV
218,THREEPIO,Deactivate!  Well on the other hand if you hadnt removed his restraining bolt...,IV
219,LUKE,Wait theres something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.,IV
220,LUKE,Hey whoa just where do you think youre going?,IV
221,THREEPIO,Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  Well have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and dont talk to me of your mission either.  Youre fortunate he doesnt blast you into a million pieces right here.,IV
222,LUKE,Well come on. Its getting late.  I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.,IV
223,THREEPIO,If you dont mind my saying so sir I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until youve gotten him back to your workshop.,IV
224,LUKE,No hes not going to try anything.,IV
225,LUKE,Whats wrong with him now?,IV
226,THREEPIO,Oh my... sir he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.,IV
227,LUKE,Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on lets have a look.  Come on.,IV
228,LUKE,There are two Banthas down there but I dont see any... wait a second theyre Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.,IV
229,BEN,Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Dont be afraid.,IV
230,BEN,Dont worry hell be all right.,IV
231,LUKE,What happened?,IV
232,BEN,Rest easy son youve had a busy day.  Youre fortunate youre still in one piece.,IV
233,LUKE,Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy am I glad to see you! ,IV
234,BEN,The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me young Luke what brings you out this far?,IV
235,LUKE,Oh this little droid!  I think hes searching for his former master...  Ive never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?  Do you know who hes talking about?,IV
236,BEN,Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I havent heard in a long time... a long time.,IV
237,LUKE,I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.,IV
238,BEN,Oh hes not dead no... not yet.,IV
239,LUKE,You know him!,IV
240,BEN,Well of course of course I know him.  Hes me!  I havent gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh before you were born.,IV
241,LUKE,Then the droid does belong to you.,IV
242,BEN,Dont seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting... ,IV
243,BEN,I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.,IV
244,LUKE,... Threepio!,IV
245,THREEPIO,Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...,IV
246,LUKE,Can you stand?  Weve got to get out of here before the Sand People return.,IV
247,THREEPIO,I dont think I can make it.  You go on Master Luke.  Theres no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  Im done for.,IV
248,LUKE,No youre not.  What kind of talk is that?,IV
249,BEN,Quickly son... theyre on the move.,IV
250,LUKE,No my father didnt fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.,IV
251,BEN,Thats what your uncle told you.  He didnt hold with your fathers ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.,IV
252,LUKE,You fought in the Clone Wars?,IV
253,BEN,Yes I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.,IV
254,LUKE,I wish Id known him.,IV
255,BEN,He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior.  I understand youve become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me...,IV
256,BEN,I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldnt allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. ,IV
257,THREEPIO,Sir if youll not be needing me Ill close down for awhile.,IV
258,LUKE,Sure go ahead.,IV
259,LUKE,What is it?,IV
260,BEN,Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.,IV
261,BEN,An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times before the Empire.,IV
262,LUKE,How did my father die?,IV
263,BEN,A young Jedi named Darth Vader who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.,IV
264,LUKE,The Force?,IV
265,BEN,Well the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  Its an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together.,IV
266,BEN,Now lets see if we cant figure out what you are my little friend.  And where you come from.,IV
267,LUKE,I saw part of the message he was...,IV
268,BEN,I seem to have found it.,IV
269,LEIA,General Kenobi years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my fathers request to you in person but my ship has fallen under attack and Im afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi youre my only hope.,IV
270,BEN,You must learn the ways of the Force if youre to come with me to Alderaan.,IV
271,LUKE,Alderaan?  Im not going to Alderaan.  Ive got to go home.  Its late Im in for it as it is.,IV
272,BEN,I need your help Luke.  Im getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help.,IV
273,LUKE,I cant get involved!  Ive got work to do!  Its not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But theres nothing I can do about it right now.  Its such a long way from here.,IV
274,BEN,Thats your uncle talking.,IV
275,LUKE,Oh God my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?,IV
276,BEN,Learn about the Force Luke.,IV
277,LUKE,Look I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever youre going.,IV
278,BEN,You must do what you feel is right of course.,IV
279,TAGGE,Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  Theyre more dangerous than you realize.,IV
280,MOTTI,Dangerous to your starfleet Commander; not to this battle station!,IV
281,TAGGE,The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....,IV
282,TARKIN,The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.  Ive just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.  The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.,IV
283,TAGGE,Thats impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?,IV
284,TARKIN,The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.,IV
285,TAGGE,And what of the Rebellion?  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station it is possible however unlikely that they might find a weakness and exploit it.,IV
286,VADER,The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.,IV
287,MOTTI,Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture no matter what technical data theyve obtained.  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it!,IV
288,VADER,Dont be too proud of this technological terror youve constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.,IV
289,MOTTI,Dont try to frighten us with your sorcerers ways Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebels hidden fort...,IV
290,VADER,I find your lack of faith disturbing.,IV
291,TARKIN,Enough of this!  Vader release him!,IV
292,VADER,As you wish.,IV
293,TARKIN,This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.,IV
294,LUKE,It looks like Sand People did this all right.  Look here are gaffi sticks bantha tracks.  Its just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.,IV
295,BEN,They didnt.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.,IV
296,LUKE,These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.,IV
297,BEN,And these blast points too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.,IV
298,LUKE,Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?,IV
299,LUKE,If they traced the robots here they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!,IV
300,BEN,Wait Luke!  Its too dangerous.,IV
301,LUKE,Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!,IV
302,VADER,And now Your Highness we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.,IV
303,BEN,Theres nothing you could have done Luke had you been there.  Youd have been killed too and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.,IV
304,LUKE,I want to come with you to Alderaan.  Theres nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.,IV
305,BEN,Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.,IV
306,TROOPER,How long have you had these droids?,IV
307,LUKE,About three or four seasons.,IV
308,BEN,Theyre for sale if you want them.,IV
309,TROOPER,Let me see your identification.,IV
310,BEN,You dont need to see his identification.,IV
311,TROOPER,We dont need to see his identification.,IV
312,BEN,looking for.,IV
313,TROOPER,These are not the droids were looking for.,IV
314,BEN,He can go about his business.,IV
315,TROOPER,You can go about your business.,IV
316,BEN,Move along.,IV
317,TROOPER,Move along.  Move along.,IV
318,THREEPIO,I cant abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.,IV
319,LUKE,Go on go on.  I cant understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.,IV
320,BEN,The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.,IV
321,LUKE,Do you really think were going to find a pilot here thatll take us to Alderaan?,IV
322,BEN,Well most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.,IV
323,LUKE,Im ready for anything.,IV
324,THREEPIO,Come along Artoo.,IV
325,BARTENDER,We dont serve their kind here!,IV
326,LUKE,What?,IV
327,BARTENDER,Your droids. Theyll have to wait outside.  We dont want them here.,IV
328,LUKE,Listen why dont you wait out by the speeder.  We dont want any trouble.,IV
329,THREEPIO,I heartily agree with you sir.,IV
330,CREATURE,Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?,IV
331,HUMAN,He doesnt like you.,IV
332,LUKE,Im sorry.,IV
333,HUMAN,I dont like you either,IV
334,HUMAN,Dont insult us.  You just watch yourself.  Were wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.,IV
335,LUKE,Ill be careful than.,IV
336,HUMAN,Youll be dead.,IV
337,BEN,This little one isnt worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...,IV
338,BARTENDER,No blasters!  No blaster!,IV
339,BEN,This is Chewbacca.  Hes first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.,IV
340,THREEPIO,I dont like the look of this.,IV
341,HAN,Han Solo.  Im captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me youre looking for passage to the Alderaan system.,IV
342,BEN,Yes indeed.  If its a fast ship.,IV
343,HAN,Fast ship?  Youve never heard of the Millennium Falcon?,IV
344,BEN,Should I have?,IV
345,HAN,Its the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!,IV
346,HAN,Ive outrun Imperial starships not the local bulk-cruisers mind you.  Im talking about the big Corellian ships now.  Shes fast enough for you old man.  Whats the cargo?,IV
347,BEN,Only passengers.  Myself the boy two droids and no questions asked.,IV
348,HAN,What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?,IV
349,BEN,Lets just say wed like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.,IV
350,HAN,Well thats the real trick isnt it?  And its going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.,IV
351,LUKE,Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!,IV
352,HAN,But whos going to fly it kid!  You?,IV
353,LUKE,You bet I could.  Im not such a bad pilot myself!  We dont have to sit here and listen...,IV
354,BEN,We havent that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.,IV
355,HAN,Seventeen huh!,IV
356,HAN,Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  Well leave as soon as youre ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.,IV
357,BEN,Ninety-four.,IV
358,HAN,Looks like somebodys beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.,IV
359,TROOPER,All right well check it out.,IV
360,HAN,Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.,IV
361,BEN,Youll have to sell your speeder.,IV
362,LUKE,Thats okay.  Im never coming back to this planet again.,IV
363,GREEDO,Going somewhere Solo?,IV
364,HAN,Yes Greedo.  As a matter of fact I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that Ive got his money.,IV
365,GREEDO,Its too late.  You should have paid him when you had the chance.  Jabbas put a price on your head so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.  Im lucky I found you first.,IV
366,HAN,Yeah but this time I got the money.,IV
367,GREEDO,If you give it to me I might forget I found you.,IV
368,HAN,I dont have it with me.  Tell Jabba...,IV
369,GREEDO,Jabbas through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.,IV
370,HAN,Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?,IV
371,GREEDO,You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.,IV
372,HAN,Over my dead body.,IV
373,GREEDO,Thats the idea Ive been looking forward to killing you for a long time.,IV
374,HAN,Yes Ill bet you have.,IV
375,HAN,Sorry about the mess.,IV
376,VADER,Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.,IV
377,IMPERIAL,OFFICER The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?,IV
378,TARKIN,Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.,IV
379,VADER,What do you mean?,IV
380,TARKIN,I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leias home planet of Alderaan.,IV
381,TROOPER,With pleasure.,IV
382,THREEPIO,Lock the door Artoo.,IV
383,TROOPER,All right check that side of the street.  Its secure.  Move on to the next door.,IV
384,THREEPIO,I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I dont know what all this trouble is about but Im sure it must be your fault.,IV
385,THREEPIO,You watch your language!,IV
386,LUKE,He says its the best he can do.  Since the XP-38 came out they ,IV
387,BEN,It will be enough.,IV
388,BEN,If the ships as fast as hes boasting we ought to do well.,IV
389,JABBA,Come on out Solo!,IV
390,HAN,Ive been waiting for you Jabba.,IV
391,JABBA,I expected you would be.,IV
392,HAN,Im not the type to run.,IV
393,JABBA,Han my boy there are times when you disappoint me... why havent you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all weve been through together.,IV
394,HAN,You sent Greedo to blast me.,IV
395,JABBA,Han why youre the best smuggler in the business.  Youre too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasnt going to blast you.,IV
396,HAN,I think he thought he was.  Next time dont send one of those twerps.  If youve got something to say to me come see me yourself.,IV
397,JABBA,Han Han!  If only you hadnt had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just cant make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  Its not good business.,IV
398,HAN,You know even I get boarded sometimes Jabba.  I had no choice but Ive gota charter now and I can pay you back plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.,IV
399,JABBA,Put your blasters away.  Han my boy Im only doing this because youre the best and I need you.  So for an extra say... twenty percent Ill give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again Ill put a price on your head so large you wont be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.,IV
400,HAN,Jabba Ill pay you because its my pleasure.,IV
401,LUKE,What a piece of junk.,IV
402,HAN,Shell make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much but shes got it where it counts kid.  Ive added some special modifications myself.,IV
403,HAN,Were a little rushed so if youll hurry aboard well get out of here.,IV
404,THREEPIO,Hello sir.,IV
405,TROOPER,Which way?,IV
406,TROOPER,All right men.  Load your weapons!,IV
407,TROOPER,Stop that ship!,IV
408,TROOPER,Blast em!,IV
409,HAN,Chewie get us out of here!,IV
410,THREEPIO,Oh my.  Id forgotten how much I hate space travel.,IV
411,HAN,It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.,IV
412,HAN,Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; theyre going to try to cut us off.,IV
413,LUKE,Why dont you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.,IV
414,HAN,Watch your mouth kid or youre going to find yourself floating home.  Well be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides I know a few maneuvers. Well lose them!,IV
415,HAN,Heres where the fun begins!,IV
416,BEN,How long before you can make the jump to light speed?,IV
417,HAN,Itll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.,IV
418,LUKE,Are you kidding?  At the rate theyre gaining...,IV
419,HAN,Traveling through hyperspace isnt like dusting crops boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and thatd end your trip real quick wouldnt it?,IV
420,LUKE,Whats that flashing?,IV
421,HAN,Were losing our deflector shield.  Go strap yourself in Im going to make the jump to light speed.,IV
422,MOTTI,Weve entered the Alderaan system.,IV
423,LEIA,Governor Tarkin I should have expected to find you holding Vaders leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.,IV
424,TARKIN,Charming to the last.  You dont know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!,IV
425,LEIA,to take the responsibility yourself!,IV
426,TARKIN,Princess Leia before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.,IV
427,LEIA,The more you tighten your grip Tarkin the more star systems will slip through your fingers.,IV
428,TARKIN,Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way you have determined the choice of the planet thatll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base I have chosen to test this stations destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.,IV
429,LEIA,No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You cant possibly...,IV
430,TARKIN,You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!,IV
431,TARKIN,I grow tired of asking this.  So itll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?,IV
432,LEIA,Dantooine.,IV
433,LEIA,Theyre on Dantooine.,IV
434,TARKIN,There.  You see Lord Vader she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.,IV
435,LEIA,What?,IV
436,TARKIN,Youre far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But dont worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. ,IV
437,LEIA,No!,IV
438,VADER,Commence primary ignition.,IV
439,LUKE,Are you all right?  Whats wrong?,IV
440,BEN,I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.,IV
441,BEN,Youd better get on with your exercises.,IV
442,HAN,Well you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you Id outrun em.,IV
443,HAN,Dont everyone thank me at once.,IV
444,HAN,Anyway we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.,IV
445,THREEPIO,Now be careful Artoo.,IV
446,THREEPIO,He made a fair move.  Screaming about it wont help you.,IV
447,HAN,Let him have it. Its not wise to upset a Wookiee.,IV
448,THREEPIO,But sir nobody worries about upsetting a droid.,IV
449,HAN,Thats cause droids dont pull peoples arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.,IV
450,THREEPIO,I see your point sir.  I suggest a new strategy Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.,IV
451,BEN,Remember a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.,IV
452,LUKE,You mean it controls your actions?,IV
453,BEN,Partially. But it also obeys your commands.,IV
454,HAN,Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side kid.,IV
455,LUKE,You dont believe in the Force do you?,IV
456,HAN,Kid Ive flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  Ive seen a lot of strange stuff but Ive never seen anything to make me believe theres one all-powerful force controlling everything.  Theres no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.,IV
457,HAN,Its all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.,IV
458,BEN,I suggest you try it again Luke.,IV
459,BEN,This time let go your conscious self and act on instinct.,IV
460,LUKE,With the blast shield down I cant even see.  How am I supposed to fight?,IV
461,BEN,Your eyes can deceive you.  Dont trust them.,IV
462,BEN,Stretch out with your feelings.,IV
463,BEN,You see you can do it.,IV
464,HAN,I call it luck. ,IV
465,BEN,In my experience theres no such thing as luck.,IV
466,HAN,Look going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  Thats something else.,IV
467,HAN,Looks like were coming up on Alderaan.,IV
468,LUKE,You know I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote.,IV
469,BEN,Thats good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.,IV
470,TARKIN,Yes.,IV
471,OFFICER,CASS Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.,IV
472,TARKIN,She lied!  She lied to us!,IV
473,VADER,I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.,IV
474,TARKIN,Terminate her... immediately!,IV
475,HAN,Stand by Chewie here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.,IV
476,HAN,What the...?  Aw weve come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  Its not on any of the charts.,IV
477,LUKE,Whats going on?,IV
478,HAN,Our position is correct except... no Alderaan!,IV
479,LUKE,What do you mean?  Where is it?,IV
480,HAN,Thats what Im trying to tell you kid.  It aint there.  Its been totally blown away.,IV
481,LUKE,What?  How?,IV
482,BEN,Destroyed... by the Empire!,IV
483,HAN,The entire starfleet couldnt destroy the whole planet.  Itd take a thousand ships with more fire power than Ive...,IV
484,HAN,Theres another ship coming in.,IV
485,LUKE,Maybe they know what happened.,IV
486,BEN,Its an Imperial fighter.,IV
487,LUKE,It followed us!,IV
488,BEN,No.  Its a short range fighter.,IV
489,HAN,There arent any bases around here.  Where did it come from?,IV
490,LUKE,It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us were in big trouble.,IV
491,HAN,Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam its transmissions.,IV
492,BEN,Itd be as well to let it go.  Its too far out of range.,IV
493,HAN,Not for long...,IV
494,BEN,A fighter that size couldnt get this deep into space on its own.,IV
495,LUKE,Then he must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something...,IV
496,HAN,Well he aint going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.,IV
497,LUKE,Look at him.  Hes heading for that small moon.,IV
498,HAN,I think I can get him before he gets there... hes almost in range.,IV
499,BEN,Thats no moon!  Its a space station.,IV
500,HAN,Its too big to be a space station.,IV
501,LUKE,I have a very bad feeling about this.,IV
502,BEN,Turn the ship around!,IV
503,HAN,Yeah I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie lock in the auxiliary power.,IV
504,LUKE,Why are we still moving towards it?,IV
505,HAN,Were caught in a tractor beam!  Its pulling us in!,IV
506,LUKE,But theres gotta be something you can do!,IV
507,HAN,Theres nothin I can do about it kid.  Im in full power.  Im going to have to shut down.  But theyre not going to get me without a fight!,IV
508,BEN,You cant win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.,IV
509,VOICE,OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM Clear Bay twenty-three-seven.  We are opening the magnetic field.,IV
510,OFFICER,To your stations!,IV
511,OFFICER,Come with me.,IV
512,OFFICER,Close all outboard shields!  Close all outboard shields!,IV
513,TARKIN,Yes.,IV
514,VOICE,Weve captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  Its markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.,IV
515,VADER,They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.,IV
516,VOICE,Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.,IV
517,OFFICER,Theres no one on board sir.  According to the log the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.  It must be a decoy sir.  Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.,IV
518,VADER,Did you find any droids?,IV
519,OFFICER,No sir.  If there were any on board they must also have jettisoned.,IV
520,VADER,Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.,IV
521,OFFICER,Yes sir.,IV
522,VADER,I sense something... a presence I havent felt since...,IV
523,OFFICER,Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.  I want every part of this ship checked!,IV
524,LUKE,Boy its lucky you had these compartments.,IV
525,HAN,I use them for smuggling.  I never thought Id be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off Id never get past the tractor beam.,IV
526,BEN,Leave that to me!,IV
527,HAN,Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!,IV
528,BEN,Whos the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?,IV
529,TROOPER,The ships all yours.  If the scanners pick up anything report it immediately.  All right lets go.,IV
530,HAN,Hey down there could you give us a hand with this?,IV
531,GANTRY,OFFICER TX-four-one-two.  Why arent you at your post?  TX-four-one-two do you copy? ,IV
532,GANTRY,OFFICER Take over.  Weve got a bad transmitter.  Ill see what I can do.,IV
533,LUKE,You know between his howling and your blasting everything in sight its a wonder the whole station doesnt know were here.,IV
534,HAN,Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.,IV
535,THREEPIO,We found the computer outlet sir.,IV
536,BEN,Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.,IV
537,THREEPIO,He says hes found the main control to the power beam thats holding the ship here.  Hell try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.,IV
538,THREEPIO,The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.  A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.,IV
539,BEN,I dont think you boys can help.  I must go alone.,IV
540,HAN,Whatever you say.  Ive done more than I bargained for on this trip already.,IV
541,LUKE,I want to go with you.,IV
542,BEN,Be patient Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids.,IV
543,LUKE,But he can...,IV
544,BEN,They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you... always!,IV
545,HAN,Boy you said it Chewie.,IV
546,HAN,Where did you dig up that old fossil?,IV
547,LUKE,Ben is a great man.,IV
548,HAN,Yeah great at getting us into trouble.,IV
549,LUKE,I didnt hear you give any ideas...,IV
550,HAN,Well anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...,IV
551,LUKE,Who do you think...,IV
552,LUKE,What is it?,IV
553,THREEPIO,Im afraid Im not quite sure sir. He says I found her and keepsrepeating Shes here.,IV
554,LUKE,Well who... who has he found?,IV
555,THREEPIO,Princess Leia.,IV
556,LUKE,The princess?  Shes here?,IV
557,HAN,Princess?,IV
558,LUKE,Where... where is she?,IV
559,HAN,Princess?  Whats going on?,IV
560,THREEPIO,Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three.  Im afraid shes scheduled to be terminated.,IV
561,LUKE,Oh no!  Weve got to do something.,IV
562,HAN,What are you talking about?,IV
563,LUKE,The droid belongs to her.  Shes the one in the message.  Weve got to help her.,IV
564,HAN,Now look dont get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.,IV
565,LUKE,But he didnt know she was here.  Look will you just find a way back into the detention block?,IV
566,HAN,Im not going anywhere.,IV
567,LUKE,Theyre going to execute her.  Look a few minutes ago you said you didnt want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay. ,IV
568,HAN,Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.,IV
569,LUKE,But theyre going to kill her!,IV
570,HAN,Better her than me...,IV
571,LUKE,Shes rich.,IV
572,HAN,Rich?,IV
573,LUKE,Yes.  Rich powerful!  Listen if you were to rescue her the reward would be...,IV
574,HAN,What?,IV
575,LUKE,Well more wealth that you can imagine.,IV
576,HAN,I dont know I can imagine quite a bit!,IV
577,LUKE,Youll get it!,IV
578,HAN,I better!,IV
579,LUKE,You will...,IV
580,HAN,All right kid.  But youd better be right about this!,IV
581,LUKE,All right.,IV
582,HAN,Whats your plan?,IV
583,LUKE,Uh... Threepio hand me those binders there will you?,IV
584,LUKE,Okay.  Now Im going to put these on you.,IV
585,LUKE,Okay.  Han you put these on.,IV
586,HAN,Dont worry Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.,IV
587,THREEPIO,Master Luke sir!  Pardon me for asking... but ah... what should Artoo and I do if were discovered here?,IV

617,VADER,A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.,IV
618,TARKIN,Surely he must be dead by now.,IV
619,VADER,Dont underestimate the Force.,IV

652,LEIA,It could be worse...,IV
653,HAN,Its worse.,IV
654,LUKE,Theres something alive in here!,IV
655,HAN,Thats your imagination.,IV
656,LUKE,Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did you see that?,IV

666,LEIA,Grab him!,IV
667,LEIA,What happened?,IV
668,LUKE,I dont know it just let go of me and disappeared...,IV
669,HAN,Ive got a very bad feeling about this.,IV
670,LUKE,The walls are moving!,IV
671,LEIA,Dont just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.,IV
672,LUKE,Wait a minute!,IV
673,LUKE,Threepio!  Come in Threepio!  Threepio!  Where could he be?,IV
674,FIRST,TROOPER Take over!See to him!  Look there!,IV
675,THREEPIO,Theyre madmen!  Theyre heading for the prison level.  If you hurry you might catch them.,IV
676,FIRST,OFFICER Follow me!  You stand guard.,IV

713,FIRST,TROOPER Give me regular reports.,IV
714,FIRST,TROOPER Do you know whats going on?,IV
715,SECOND,TROOPER Maybe its another drill.,IV
716,SECOND,TROOPER What was that?,IV

742,VADER,When I left you I was but the learner; now I am the master.,IV
743,BEN,Only a master of evil Darth.,IV
744,VADER,Your powers are weak old man.,IV
745,BEN,You cant win Darth.  If you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.,IV
746,HAN,Didnt we just leave this party?,IV
747,HAN,What kept you?,IV
748,LEIA,We ran into some old friends.,IV
749,LUKE,Is the ship all right?,IV

772,HAN,Great kid!  Dont get cocky.,IV
773,LEIA,There are still two more of them out there!,IV
774,LUKE,Thats it!  We did it!,IV
775,LEIA,We did it!,IV
776,THREEPIO,Help!  I think Im melting!This is all your fault.,IV
777,TARKIN,Are they away?,IV
778,VADER,They have just made the jump into hyperspace.,IV
779,TARKIN,Youre sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  Im taking an awful risk Vader.  This had better work.,IV
780,HAN,Not a bad bit of rescuing huh?  You know sometimes I even amaze myself.,IV
781,LEIA,That doesnt sound too hard.  Besides they let us go.  Its the only explanation for the ease of our escape.,IV
782,HAN,Easy... you call that easy?,IV
783,LEIA,Their tracking us!,IV
784,HAN,Not this ship sister.,IV
785,LEIA,At least the information in Artoo is still intact.,IV
786,HAN,Whats so important?  Whats he carrying?,IV
787,LEIA,The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed a weakness can be found.  Its not over yet!,IV
788,HAN,It is for me sister!  Look I aint in this for your revolution and Im not in it for you Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  Im in it for the money!,IV
789,LEIA,You neednt worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love then thats what youll receive!,IV
790,LEIA,Your friend is quite a mercenary.  I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.,IV
791,LUKE,I care!,IV
792,LUKE,So... what do you think of her Han?,IV
793,HAN,Im trying not to kid!,IV
794,LUKE,Good...,IV
795,HAN,Still shes got a lot of spirit.  I dont know what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me...,IV
796,LUKE,No!,IV
797,WILLARD,Youre safe!  We had feared the worst.,IV
798,WILLARD,When we heard about Alderaan we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.,IV
799,LEIA,We dont have time for our sorrows commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here.Its the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope.,IV
800,TARKIN,Yes.,IV
801,DEATH,STAR INTERCOM VOICE We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.,IV
802,DODONNA,The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.,IV
803,GOLD,LEADER Pardon me for asking sir but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?,IV
804,DODONNA,Well the Empire doesnt consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat or theyd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.,IV
805,DODONNA,The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  Its a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.,IV
806,DODONNA,Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded so youll have to use proton torpedoes.,IV
807,WEDGE,Thats impossible even for a computer.,IV
808,LUKE,Its not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  Theyre not much bigger than two meters.,IV
809,DODONNA,Man your ships!  And may the Force be with you!,IV
810,DEATH,STAR INTERCOM VOICE Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.,IV
811,VADER,This will be a day long remembered.  It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.,IV
812,MAN,All flight troops man your stations.  All flight troops man your stations.,IV
813,LUKE,So... you got your reward and youre just leaving then?,IV
814,HAN,Thats right yeah!  I got some old debts Ive got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didnt you dont think Id be fool enough to stick around here do you?  Why dont you come with us?  Youre pretty good in a fight.  I could use you.,IV
815,LUKE,Come on!  Why dont you take a look around?  You know whats about to happen what theyre up against.  They could use a good pilot like you.  Youre turning your back on them.,IV
816,HAN,What goods a reward if you aint around to use it?  Besides attacking that battle station aintmy idea of courage.  Its more like suicide.,IV
817,LUKE,All right.  Well take care of yourself Han... guess thats what youre best at isnt it?,IV
818,HAN,Hey Luke... may the Force be with you!,IV
819,HAN,Whatre you lookin at?  I know what Im doing.,IV
820,LEIA,Whats wrong?,IV
821,LUKE,Oh its Han!  I dont know I really thought hed change his mind. ,IV
822,LEIA,Hes got to follow his own path.  No one can choose it for him.,IV
823,LUKE,I only wish Ben were here.,IV
824,BIGGS,Luke!  I dont believe it!  Howd you get here... are you going out with us?!,IV
825,LUKE,Biggs!  Of course Ill be up there with you!  Listen have I got some stories to tell...,IV
826,RED,LEADER Are you... Luke Skywalker?  Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?,IV
827,BIGGS,Sir Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.,IV
828,RED,LEADER I met your father once when I was just a boy.  He was a great pilot.  Youll do all right.  If youve got half of your fathers skill youll do better than all right.,IV
829,LUKE,Thank you sir.  Ill try.,IV
830,BIGGS,Ive got to get aboard.  Listen youll tell me your stories when we come back.  All right?,IV
831,LUKE,I told you Id make it someday Biggs.,IV
832,BIGGS,You did all right.  Its going to be like old times Luke. Were a couple of shooting stars thatll never be stopped!,IV
833,CHIEF,This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?,IV
834,LUKE,Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together.You okay Artoo?,IV
835,CHIEF,Okay easy she goes!,IV
836,THREEPIO,Hang on tight Artoo youve got to come back.,IV

16,HAN,Well theres a price on my head. If I dont pay off Jabba the  Hut Im a dead man.,V

34,LEIA,Yes. Youre a great help to us. Youre a natural leader...,V
35,HAN,No! Thats not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.,V

38,LEIA,Id just as soon kiss a Wookiee.,V
39,HAN,I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!,V
40,THREEPIO,Dont try to blame me. I didnt ask you to turn on the  thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princesss chamber. But its supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really dont know.,V
41,THREEPIO,Oh switch off.,V
42,HAN,Why do you take this apart now? Im trying to get us  out of here and you pull both of these.,V

65,HAN,Not likely. Are the speeders ready?,V
66,DECK,OFFICER Not yet. Were having some trouble adapting them to the  cold.,V
67,HAN,Then well have to go out on Tauntauns.,V

74,THREEPIO,Dont say thing like that! Of course well see Master Luke  again. Hell be quite all right youll see.  Stupid little short-circuit. Hell be quite all right.,V
75,LIEUTENANT,Sir all the patrols are in. Theres still no contact from  Skywalker or Solo.,V
76,THREEPIO,Mistress Leia Artoo says hes been quite unable to pick up  any signals although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.,V
77,DERLIN,Your Highness theres nothing more we can do tonight. The  shield doors must be closed.,V
78,DERLIN,Close the doors.,V
79,LIEUTENANT,Yes sir.,V
80,THREEPIO,Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred  seventy-five...to one.,V
81,THREEPIO,Actually Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time  to time. Oh dear oh dear. Dont worry about Master Luke. Im sure hell be all right. Hes quite clever you know...for a human being.,V
82,BEN,Luke...Luke.,V
83,LUKE,Ben?,V
84,BEN,You will go to the Dagobah system.,V

98,ZEV,Echo Base...Ive got something! Not much but  it could be a life form.,V
99,ZEV,This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain  Solo so you copy? Commander Skywalker do you copy? This is Rouge Two.,V
100,HAN,Good morning. Nice of you guys to  drop by.,V
101,ZEV,Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found  them. Repeat I found them.,V
102,THREEPIO,Master Luke sir its good to see you fully functional  again.,V
103,THREEPIO,Artoo expresses his relief also.,V
104,HAN,How are you feeling kid? You dont look so bad to me. In fact  you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.,V
105,LUKE,Thanks to you.,V
106,HAN,Thats two you owe me junior.,V
107,HAN,Well your Worship looks like you managed to keep me around for a  little while longer.,V
108,LEIA,I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks  its dangerous for any ships to leave the system until weve activated the energy shield.,V
109,HAN,Thats a good story. I think you just cant bear to let a  gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.,V
110,LEIA,I dont know where you get you delusions laser brain.,V
111,HAN,Laugh it up fuzz ball. But you didnt see us alone in the south  passage.,V
112,HAN,She expressed her true feelings for me.,V
113,LEIA,My...! Why you stuck up...half-witted...scruffy-looking...  nerf-herder!,V
114,HAN,Whos scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close  to the mark to get her all riled up like that huh kid?,V
115,LEIA,Why I guess you dont know everything about women yet?,V
116,ANNOUNCER,Headquarters personnel report to command  center.,V
117,HAN,Take it easy.,V
118,THREEPIO,Excuse us please.,V
119,RIEEKAN,Princess...we have a visitor.,V
120,RIEEKAN,Weve picked up something outside the base in zone twelve  moving east.,V
121,SENIOR,CONTROLLER Its metal.,V
122,LEIA,Then it couldnt be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.,V
123,HAN,It could be a speeder one of ours.,V
124,SENIOR,CONTROLLER No. Wait -- theres something very weak coming  through.,V
125,THREEPIO,Sir I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This  signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.,V
126,HAN,It isnt friendly whatever it is. Come on Chewie lets check  it out.,V
127,RIEEKAN,Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.,V
128,HAN,Afraid theres not much left.,V
129,LEIA,What was it?,V
130,HAN,Droid of some kind. I didnt hit it that hard. It  must have had a self-destruct.,V
131,LEIA,An Imperial probe droid.,V
132,HAN,Its a good bet the Empire knows were here.,V
133,RIEEKAN,Wed better start the evacuation.,V
134,PIETT,Admiral.,V
135,OZZEL,Yes Captain,V
136,PIETT,I think weve got something sir. The report is only a fragment  had.,V
137,OZZEL,We have thousands of probe droids searching the  galaxy. I want proof not leads!,V
138,PIETT,The visuals indicate life readings.,V
139,OZZEL,It could mean anything. If we followed every lead...,V
140,PIETT,But sir the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human  forms.,V
141,VADER,You found something?,V
142,PIETT,Yes my lord.,V
143,VADER,Thats it. The  Rebels are there.,V
144,OZZEL,My lord there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be  smugglers it could be...,V
145,VADER,That is the system. And Im sure Skywalker is with them. Set  your course for the Hoth system. General Veers prepare you men.,V
146,REBEL,CAPTAIN Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the  speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch.,V
147,REBEL,FIGHTER Right sir.,V
148,HAN,Okay thats it. Try it...Off! Turn it  off! Turn it off! Off!,V
149,MEDICAL,DROID Sir it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-  sevens.,V
150,LUKE,Well forget the heavy equipment. Theres plenty of time to get  the smaller modules on the transports.,V
151,MEDICAL,DROID Take care sir.,V
152,LUKE,Thanks.,V
153,LUKE,Chewie take care of yourself okay?,V
154,HAN,Hi kid.  Theres got to be a reason for it. Check it  at the other end. Wait a second.  You all right?,V
155,LUKE,Yeah.,V
156,HAN,Be careful.,V
157,LUKE,You too.,V
158,CONTROLLER,General theres a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of  hyperspace in sector four.,V
159,RIEEKAN,Reroute all power to the energy shield. Weve got to hold  them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.,V
160,VADER,What is it General?,V
161,VEERS,My lord the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has  detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.,V
162,VADER,The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel  came out of light-speed too close to the system.,V
163,VEERS,He felt surprise was wiser...,V
164,VADER,He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General prepare your troops  for a surface attack.,V
165,VEERS,Yes my lord.,V
166,OZZEL,Lord Vader the fleet has moved out of light-speed and were  preparing to...Aaagh!,V
167,VADER,You have failed me for the last time Admiral. Captain Piett.,V
168,PIETT,Yes my lord.,V
169,VADER,Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and  deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now Admiral Piett.,V
170,PIETT,Thank you Lord Vader.,V
171,LEIA,All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The  heavy transport ships will leave as soon as theyre loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time so youll have to stay very close to your transports.,V
172,HOBBIE,Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?,V
173,LEIA,The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any  enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When youve gotten past the energy shield proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?,V
174,PILOTS,Right. Okay.,V
175,LEIA,Good luck.,V
176,DERLIN,Okay. Everyone to your stations. Lets go!,V
177,RIEEKAN,Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to  open the shield.,V
178,CONTROLLER,Sir Rebel ships are coming into our sector.,V
179,CAPTAIN,Good. Our first catch of the day.,V
180,WOMAN,CONTROLLER Stand by ion control....Fire!,V
181,ANNOUNCER,The first transport is away.,V
182,DACK,Feeling all right sir?,V
183,LUKE,Just like new Dack. How about you?,V
184,DACK,Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself.,V
185,LUKE,I know what you mean.,V
186,TRENCH,OFFICER Echo Station Three-T-Eight.,V
187,TRENCH,OFFICER We have spotted Imperial walkers!,V
188,CONTROLLER,Imperial walkers on the north ridge.,V
189,LUKE,Echo station Five-Seven. Were on our way.,V
190,LUKE,All right boys keep tight now.,V
191,DACK,Luke I have no approach vector. Im not set.,V

197,DACK,Luke weve got a malfunction in fire control. Ill have to cut  in the auxiliary.,V
198,LUKE,Just hang on. Hang on Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable.,V
199,LUKE,Dack? Dack!,V

215,WEDGE,Whooha!! That got him!,V
216,LUKE,I see it Wedge. Good work.,V
217,RIEEKAN,I dont think we can protect two transports at a time.,V
218,LEIA,Its risky but we cant hold out much longer. We have no  choice.,V
219,RIEEKAN,Launch patrols.,V
220,LEIA,Evacuate remaining ground staff.,V
221,HAN,No no! No! This one goes there that one goes there. right?,V

237,THREEPIO,Your Highness we must take this last transport. Its our  only hope.,V

319,LUKE,Yes thats it. Dagobah.,V
320,LUKE,No Im not going to change my mind about this.   Im not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings though. Theres something alive down there...,V
321,LUKE,Yes Im sure its perfectly safe for droids.,V

323,LUKE,No Artoo you stay put. Ill have a look around.,V

331,VADER,Yes Admiral?,V
332,PIETT,Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon lord. But...it  has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk...,V
333,VADER,Asteroids do not concern me Admiral. I want  that ship and not excuses.,V
334,PIETT,Yes lord.,V
335,HAN,Im going to shut down everything but the emergency power  systems.,V

337,HAN,No I need you to talk to the Falcon find out whats wrong with  the hyperdrive.,V
338,THREEPIO,Sir its quite possible this asteroid is not entirely  stable.,V
339,HAN,Not entirely stable? Im glad youre here to tell us these  things.  Chewie take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.,V
340,THREEPIO,Oh! Sometimes I just dont understand human behavior. After  all Im only trying to do my job in the most...,V
341,LEIA,Let go.,V
342,HAN,Sshh!,V
343,LEIA,Let go please.,V
344,HAN,Dont get excited.,V
345,LEIA,Captain being held by you isnt quite enough to get me excited.,V
346,HAN,Sorry sweetheart. We havent got time for anything else.,V
347,LUKE,Ready for some power? Okay. Lets see now. Put that in there.  There you go.,V
348,LUKE,Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even  exists.,V
349,LUKE,Still...theres something familiar about this place. I feel  like...I dont know...,V
350,STRANGE,VOICE Feel like what?,V
351,LUKE,Like were being watched!,V
352,CREATURE,Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm.,V
353,CREATURE,I am wondering why are you here?,V
354,LUKE,Im looking for someone.,V
355,CREATURE,Looking? Found someone you have I would say hmmm?,V
356,LUKE,Right.,V
357,CREATURE,Help you I can. Yes mmmm.,V
358,LUKE,I dont think so. Im looking for a great warrior.,V
359,CREATURE,Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not  make one great.,V
360,LUKE,Put that down. Hey! Thats my dinner.,V
361,CREATURE,How you get so big eating food of this kind?,V
362,LUKE,Listen friend we didnt mean to land in that puddle and if we  could get our ship out we would but we cant so why dont you just...,V
363,CREATURE,Aww cannot get your ship out?,V

376,LUKE,Im not looking for a friend Im looking for a Jedi Master.,V
377,CREATURE,Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.,V
378,LUKE,You know him?,V
379,CREATURE,Mmm. Take you to him I will.  Yes yes. But now we  must eat. Come. Good food. Come.,V
380,CREATURE,Come come.,V
381,LUKE,Stay here and watch after the camp Artoo.,V
382,THREEPIO,Oh where is Artoo when I need him?,V
383,THREEPIO,Sir I dont know where your ship learned to communicate  but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe sir it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. Im afraid youll have to replace it.,V
384,HAN,Well of course Ill have to replace it.,V
385,HAN,Here! And Chewie...,V
386,HAN,...I think wed better replace the negative power  coupling.,V
387,HAN,Hey Your Worship Im only trying to help.,V
388,LEIA,Would you please stop calling me that?,V
389,HAN,Sure Leia.,V
390,LEIA,Oh you make it so difficult sometimes.,V
391,HAN,I do I really do. You could be a little nicer though.  Come on admit it. Sometimes you think Im all right.,V
392,LEIA,Occasionally  maybe...when you arent  acting like a scoundrel.,V
393,HAN,Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.,V
394,LEIA,Stop that.,V
395,HAN,Stop what?,V
396,LEIA,Stop that! My hands are dirty.,V
397,HAN,My hands are dirty too. What are you afraid of?,V
398,LEIA,Afraid?,V
399,HAN,Youre trembling.,V
400,LEIA,Im not trembling.,V
401,HAN,You like me because Im a scoundrel. There arent enough  scoundrels in your life.,V
402,LEIA,I happen to like nice men.,V
403,HAN,Im a nice man.,V
404,LEIA,No youre not. Youre...,V
405,THREEPIO,Sir sir! Ive isolated the reverse power flux coupling.,V
406,HAN,Thank you. Thank you very much.,V
407,THREEPIO,Oh youre perfectly welcome sir.,V
408,NEEDA,...and that Lord Vader was the last time they  appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage weve sustained they must have been destroyed.,V
409,VADER,No Captain theyre alive. I want every ship available to  sweep the asteroid field until they are found.,V
410,PIETT,Lord Vader.,V
411,VADER,Yes Admiral what is it?,V
412,PIETT,The Emperor commands you make contact with him.,V
413,VADER,Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a  clear transmission.,V
414,PIETT,Yes my lord.,V
415,VADER,What is thy bidding my master?,V
416,EMPEROR,There is a great disturbance in the Force.,V
417,VADER,I have felt it.,V
418,EMPEROR,We have a new enemy -- Luke Skywalker.,V
419,VADER,Yes my master.,V
420,EMPEROR,He could destroy us.,V
421,VADER,Hes just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.,V
422,EMPEROR,The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not  become a Jedi.,V
423,VADER,If he could be turned he would become a powerful ally.,V
424,EMPEROR,Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?,V
425,VADER,He will join us or die my master.,V
426,LUKE,Look Im sure its delicious. I just dont understand why we  cant see Yoda now.,V
427,CREATURE,Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat eat.  Hot. Good food hm? Good hmm?,V
428,LUKE,How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?,V
429,CREATURE,Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him.   Rootleaf I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?,V
430,LUKE,Mostly because of my father I guess.,V
431,CREATURE,Ah your father. Powerful Jedi was he powerful Jedi mmm.,V
432,LUKE,Oh come on. How could you know my father? You  dont even know who I am.  Oh I dont even know what Im doing here. Were wasting our time.,V
433,CREATURE,I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.,V
434,BEN,He will learn patience.,V
435,YODA,Hmmm. Much anger in him like his father.,V
436,BEN,Was I any different when you taught me?,V
437,YODA,Hah. He is not ready.,V
438,LUKE,Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben tell him Im  ready.,V
439,YODA,Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years  have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment the most serious mind.  This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things.  You are reckless!,V
440,BEN,So was I if youll remember.,V
441,YODA,He is too old. Yes too old to begin the training.,V
442,LUKE,But Ive learned so much.,V
443,YODA,Will he finished what he begins?,V
444,LUKE,I wont fail you -- Im not afraid.,V
445,YODA,Oh you will be. You will be.,V
446,THREEPIO,Sir if I may venture an opinion...,V
447,HAN,Im not really interested in your opinion Threepio.,V
448,LEIA,Theres something out there.,V
449,HAN,Where?,V
450,LEIA,Outside in the cave.,V
451,THREEPIO,There it is. Listen! Listen!,V
452,HAN,Im going out there.,V
453,LEIA,Are you crazy?!,V
454,HAN,I just got this bucket back together. Im not going to let  something tear it apart.,V
455,LEIA,Then Im going with you.,V
456,THREEPIO,I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the  ship.  Oh no.,V
457,LEIA,This ground sure feels strange. It doesnt feel like rock at  all.,V
458,HAN,Theres an awful lot of moisture in here.,V
459,LEIA,I dont know. I have a bad feeling about this.,V
460,HAN,Yeah.,V
461,HAN,Watch out!,V
462,HAN,Yeah thats what I thought. Mynock. Chewie check the rest of  the ship make sure there arent any more attached. Theyre chewing on the power cables.,V
463,LEIA,Mynocks?,V
464,HAN,Go on inside. Well clean them off if there are any more.,V
465,THREEPIO,Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!,V
466,HAN,Wait a minute...,V
467,HAN,All right Chewie lets get out of here!,V
468,LEIA,The Empire is still out there. I dont think its wise to...,V
469,HAN,No time to discuss this as a committee.,V
470,LEIA,I am not a committee!,V
471,LEIA,You cant make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...,V
472,HAN,Sit down sweetheart. Were taking off!,V
473,THREEPIO,Look!,V
474,HAN,I see it I see it.,V
475,THREEPIO,Were doomed!,V
476,LEIA,The cave is collapsing.,V
477,HAN,This is no cave.,V
478,LEIA,What?,V
479,YODA,Run! Yes. A Jedis strength flows from the Force. But beware of  the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny consume you it will as it did Obi-Wans apprentice.,V
480,LUKE,Vader. Is the dark side stronger?,V
481,YODA,No...no...no. Quicker easier more seductive.,V
482,LUKE,But how am I to know the good side from the bad?,V
483,YODA,You will know. When you are calm at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses  the Force for knowledge and defense never for attack.,V
484,LUKE,But tell me why I cant...,V
485,YODA,No no there is no why. Nothing more will I  teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.,V
486,LUKE,Theres something not right here.,V
487,LUKE,I feel cold death.,V
488,YODA,That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain  of evil it is. In you must go.,V
489,LUKE,Whats in there?,V
490,YODA,Only what you take with you.,V
491,YODA,Your weapons...you will not need them.,V
492,PIETT,Bounty hunters. We dont need that scum.,V
493,FIRST,CONTROLLER Yes sir.,V
494,PIETT,Those Rebels wont escape us.,V
495,SECOND,CONTROLLER Sir we have a priority signal from the Star  Destroyer Avenger.,V
496,PIETT,Right.,V
497,VADER,...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds  the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary but I want them alive. No disintegrations.,V
498,BOBA,FETT As you wish.,V
499,PIETT,Lord Vader! My lord we have them.,V
500,THREEPIO,Oh thank goodness were coming out of the asteroid field.,V
501,HAN,Lets get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three!,V
502,HAN,Its not fair!,V
503,HAN,The transfer circuits are working. Its not my fault!,V
504,LEIA,No light-speed?,V
505,HAN,Its not my fault.,V
506,THREEPIO,Sir we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more  direct hit on the back quarter and were done for.,V
507,HAN,Turn her around.,V
508,HAN,I said turn her around! Im going to put all power in the front  shield.,V
509,LEIA,Youre going to attack them?!,V
510,THREEPIO,Sir the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial  Star Destroyer...,V
511,LEIA,Shut up!,V
512,NEEDA,Theyre moving to attack position. Shields up!,V
513,NEEDA,Track them. They may come around for another pass.,V
514,TRACKING,OFFICER Captain Needa the ship no longer appears on our  scopes.,V
515,NEEDA,They cant have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking  device.,V
516,TRACKING,OFFICER Well theres no trace of them sir.,V
517,COMMUNICATIONS,OFFICER Captain Lord Vader demands an update on the  pursuit.,V
518,NEEDA,Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full  responsibility for losing them and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile continue to scan the area.,V
519,COMMUNICATIONS,OFFICER Yes Captain Needa.,V
520,YODA,Use the Force. Yes...,V
521,YODA,Now...the stone. Feel it.,V
522,YODA,Concentrate!,V
523,LUKE,Oh no. Well never get it out now.,V
524,YODA,So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you  nothing that I say?,V
525,LUKE,Master moving stones around is one thing. This is totally  different.,V
526,YODA,No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn  what you have learned.,V
527,LUKE,All right Ill give it a try.,V
528,YODA,No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.,V
529,LUKE,I cant. Its too big.,V
530,YODA,Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size do you? Hm?  Mmmm.,V
531,YODA,And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a  powerful ally it is. Life creates it makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we......not this crude matter.  You must feel the Force around you.  Here between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes even between this land and that ship!,V
532,LUKE,You want the impossible.,V
533,LUKE,I dont...I dont believe it.,V
534,YODA,That is why you fail.,V
535,VADER,Apology accepted Captain Needa.,V
536,PIETT,Lord Vader our ships have completed their scan of the area and  found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed itll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.,V
537,VADER,Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along  their last know trajectory.,V
538,PIETT,Yes my lord. Well find them.,V
539,VADER,Dont fail me again Admiral.,V
540,PIETT,Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.,V
541,THREEPIO,Captain Solo this time you have gone too far.  No I will not be quiet Chewbacca. Why doesnt anyone listen to me?,V
542,HAN,The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand  by the manual release for the landing claw.,V
543,THREEPIO,I really dont see how thats going to help. Surrender is a  perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...,V
544,HAN,Thank you.,V
545,LEIA,What did you have in mind for your next move?,V
546,HAN,Well if they follow standard Imperial procedure theyll dump  their garbage before they go to light-speed then we just float away.,V
547,LEIA,With the rest of the garbage. Then what?,V
548,HAN,Then weve got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any  ideas?,V
549,LEIA,No. Where are we?,V
550,HAN,The Anoat system.,V
551,LEIA,Anoat system. Theres not much there.,V
552,HAN,No. Well wait. This is interesting. Lando.,V
553,LEIA,Lando system?,V
554,HAN,Landos not a system hes a man. Lando Calrissian. Hes a card  player gambler scoundrel. Youd like him.,V
555,LEIA,Thanks.,V
556,HAN,Bespin. Its pretty far but I think we can make it.,V
557,LEIA,A mining colony?,V
558,HAN,Yeah a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go  back a long way Lando and me.,V
559,LEIA,Can you trust him?,V
560,HAN,No. But he has no love for the Empire I can tell you that.,V
561,HAN,Here we go Chewie. Stand by. Detach!,V
562,LEIA,You do have your moments. Not many but you have them.,V
563,YODA,Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm yes. Through  the Force things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone.,V
564,LUKE,Han! Leia!,V
565,YODA,Hmm. Control control. You must learn control.,V
566,LUKE,I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.,V
567,YODA,Mmm. Friends you have there.,V
568,LUKE,They were in pain.,V
569,YODA,It is the future you see.,V
570,LUKE,Future? Will they die?,V
571,YODA,Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.,V
572,LUKE,Ive got to go to them.,V
573,YODA,Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now help  them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.,V
574,HAN,No I dont have a landing permit. Im trying  to reach Lando Calrissian.,V
575,HAN,Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.,V
576,INTERCOM,VOICE You will not deviate from your present course.,V
577,THREEPIO,Rather touchy arent they?,V
578,LEIA,I thought you knew this person.,V
579,HAN,Well that was a long time ago. Im sure hes  forgotten about that.,V
580,INTERCOM,VOICE Permission granted to land on Platform  Three-two-seven.,V
581,HAN,Thank you.,V
582,HAN,Theres nothing to worry about. We go way back Lando and me.,V
583,LEIA,Whos worried?,V
584,THREEPIO,Oh. No one to meet us.,V
585,LEIA,I dont like this.,V
586,HAN,Well what would you like?,V
587,THREEPIO,Well they did let us land.,V
588,HAN,Look dont worry. Everythings going to be fine. Trust me.,V
589,HAN,See? My friend.  Keep your eyes open okay?,V
590,LANDO,Why you slimy double-crossing no-good swindler! Youve got a  lot of guts coming here after what you pulled.,V
591,LANDO,How you doing you old pirate? So good to see you! I  never thought Id catch up with you again. Where you been?,V
592,THREEPIO,Well he seems very friendly.,V
593,LEIA,Yes...very friendly.,V
594,LANDO,What are you doing here?,V
595,HAN,Ahh...repairs. I thought you could  help me out.,V
596,LANDO,What have you done to my ship?,V
597,HAN,Your ship? Hey remember you lost her to me fair and square.,V
598,LANDO,Hello. What have we here? Welcome. Im Lando Calrissian. Im  the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?,V
599,LEIA,Leia.,V
600,LANDO,Welcome Leia.,V
601,HAN,All right all right you old smoothie.,V
602,THREEPIO,Hello sir. I am See-Threepio human-cyborg relations. My  facilities are at your...,V
603,THREEPIO,Well really!,V
604,LANDO,Whats wrong with the Falcon?,V
605,HAN,Hyperdrive.,V
606,LANDO,Ill get my people to work on it.,V
607,HAN,Good.,V
608,LANDO,You know that ship saved my life quite a few times. Shes the  fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.,V
609,HAN,Hows the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?,V
610,LANDO,Oh not as well as Id like. Were a small outpost and not very  self-sufficient. And Ive had supply problems of every kind. Ive had labor difficulties... Whats so funny?,V
611,HAN,You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman a responsible  leader. Whod have thought that huh?,V
612,LANDO,You know seeing you sure brings back a few things.,V
613,HAN,Yeah.,V
614,LANDO,Yeah Im responsible these days. Its the  price you pay for being successful.,V
615,THREEPIO,Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.,V
616,SECOND,THREEPIO E chu ta!,V
617,THREEPIO,How rude!,V
618,THREEPIO,That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...,V
619,THREEPIO,Hello? How interesting. Oh my.,V
620,MAN,Who are you?,V
621,THREEPIO,Oh Im terribly sorry. I...I didnt mean to intrude. No  no please dont get up. No!,V
622,YODA,Luke! You must complete the training.,V
623,LUKE,I cant keep the vision out of my head. Theyre my friends. Ive  got to help them.,V
624,YODA,You must not go!,V
625,LUKE,But Han and Leia will die if I dont.,V
626,BEN,You dont know that.,V
627,BEN,Even Yoda cannot see their fate.,V
628,LUKE,But I can help them! I feel the Force!,V
629,BEN,But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you when  you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.,V
630,YODA,Yes yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure  at the cave!,V
631,LUKE,But Ive learned so much since then. Master Yoda I promise to  return and finish what Ive begun. You have my word.,V
632,BEN,It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your  friends are made to suffer.,V
633,LUKE,And that is why I have to go.,V
634,BEN,Luke I dont want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost  Vader.,V
635,LUKE,You wont.,V
636,YODA,Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi  Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did you will become an agent of evil.,V
637,BEN,Patience.,V
638,LUKE,And sacrifice Han and Leia?,V
639,YODA,If you honor what they fight for...yes!,V
640,BEN,If you choose to face Vader you will do it alone. I cannot  interfere.,V
641,LUKE,I understand.  Artoo fire up the  converters.,V
642,BEN,Luke dont give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side.,V
643,YODA,Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.,V
644,LUKE,I will. And Ill return. I promise.,V
645,YODA,Told you I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.,V
646,BEN,That boy is our last hope.,V
647,YODA,No. There is another.,V
648,HAN,The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and were  in great shape.,V
649,LEIA,The sooner the better. Somethings wrong here. No one has seen  or knows anything about Threepio. Hes been gone too long to have gotten lost.,V
650,HAN,Relax. Ill talk to Lando and see what I can find out.,V
651,LEIA,I dont trust Lando.,V
652,HAN,Well I dont trust him either. But he is my friend. Besides  well soon be gone.,V
653,LEIA,And then youre as good as gone arent you?,V
654,LEIA,What happened?,V
655,HAN,Where? Found him in a junk pile?,V
656,LEIA,Oh what a mess. Chewie do you think you can repair him?,V
657,HAN,Landos got people who can fix him.,V
658,LEIA,No thanks.,V
659,LANDO,Im sorry. Am I interrupting anything?,V
660,LEIA,Not really.,V
661,LANDO,You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us  among the clouds.,V
662,LEIA,Thank you.,V
663,LANDO,Will you join me for a little refreshment?,V
664,LANDO,Everyones invited of course.,V
665,LANDO,Having trouble with you droid?,V
666,HAN,No. No problem. Why?,V
667,LANDO,So you see since were a small operation we dont fall into  the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire.,V
668,LEIA,So youre part of the mining guild then?,V
669,LANDO,No not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be  noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.,V
670,HAN,Arent you afraid the Empires going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down?,V
671,LANDO,Thats always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything weve built here. But things have developed that will insure security. Ive just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.,V
672,VADER,We would be honored if you would join us.,V
673,LANDO,I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. Im sorry.,V
674,HAN,Im sorry too.,V
675,LUKE,No Threepios with them.,V
676,LUKE,Just hang on. Were almost there.,V
677,THREEPIO,Mmmm. Oh my. Uh I uh -- Take this off! I uh dont mean  to intrude here. I dont no no no...Please dont get up. No!,V
678,THREEPIO,Stormtroopers? Here? Were in danger. I must tell the  others. Oh no! Ive been shot!,V
679,LANDO,Lord Vader.,V
680,VADER,You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I  have Skywalker.,V
681,BOBA,FETT Hes no good to me dead.,V
682,VADER,He will not be permanently damaged.,V
683,LANDO,Lord Vader what about Leia and the Wookiee?,V
684,VADER,They must never again leave this city.,V
685,LANDO,That was never a condition of our agreement nor was giving Han  to this bounty hunter!,V
686,VADER,Perhaps you think youre being treated unfairly.,V
687,LANDO,No.,V
688,VADER,Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison  here.,V
689,LANDO,This deals getting worse all the time.,V
690,THREEPIO,Oh yes thats very good. I like that. Oh! Somethings not  right because now I cant see. Wait. Wait! Oh my! what have you done? Im backwards you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...,V
691,HAN,I feel terrible.,V
692,LEIA,Why are they doing this?,V
693,HAN,They never even asked me any questions.,V
694,LEIA,Lando.,V
695,HAN,Get out of here Lando!,V
696,LANDO,Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie  over to me.,V
697,HAN,Over to you?,V
698,LANDO,Theyll have to stay here but at least theyll be safe.,V
699,LEIA,What about Han?,V
700,LANDO,Vaders giving him to the bounty hunter.,V
701,LEIA,Vader wants us all dead.,V
702,LANDO,He doesnt want you at all. Hes after somebody called  Skywalker.,V
703,HAN,Luke?,V
704,LANDO,Lord Vader has set a trap for him.,V
705,LEIA,And were the bait.,V
706,LANDO,Well hes on his way.,V
707,HAN,Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good didnt you?   My friend!,V
708,LANDO,Stop! Ive done all I can do. Im sorry I couldnt do better  but I have my own problems.,V
709,HAN,Yeah youre a real hero.,V
710,LEIA,You certainly have a way with people.,V
711,VADER,This facility is crude but it should be adequate to freeze  Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.,V
712,IMPERIAL,SOLDIER Lord Vader ship approaching. X-wing class.,V
713,VADER,Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.,V
714,LANDO,Lord Vader we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If  you put him in there it might kill him.,V
715,VADER,I do not want the Emperors prize damaged. We will test it...on  Captain Solo.,V
716,THREEPIO,If only you had attached my legs I wouldnt be in this  ridiculous position. Now remember Chewbacca you have a responsibility to me so dont do anything foolish.,V
717,HAN,Whats going on...buddy?,V
718,LANDO,Youre being put into carbon freeze.,V
719,BOBA,FETT What if he doesnt survive? Hes worth a lot to me.,V
720,VADER,The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!,V
721,THREEPIO,Oh no! No no no! Stop Chewbacca stop...!,V
722,HAN,Stop Chewie stop! Do you hear me? Stop!,V
723,THREEPIO,Yes stop please! Im not ready to die.,V
724,HAN,Chewie! Chewie this wont help me. Hey!,V
725,HAN,Save your strength. Therell be another time. The princess -- you  have to take care of her. You hear me?,V
726,LEIA,I love you!,V
727,HAN,I know.,V
728,THREEPIO,What...whats going on? Turn around Chewbacca I cant see.  Oh...theyve encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process that is.,V
729,VADER,Well Calrissian did he survive?,V
730,LANDO,Yes hes alive. And in perfect hibernation.,V
731,VADER,Hes all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.,V
732,IMPERIAL,OFFICER Skywalker has just landed my lord.,V
733,VADER,Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian take  the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.,V
734,LANDO,You said theyd be left in the city under my supervision.,V
735,VADER,I am altering the deal. Pray I dont alter it any further.,V
736,LEIA,Luke! Luke dont -- its a trap! Its a trap!,V
737,VADER,The Force is with you young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi  yet.,V
738,LANDO,Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it  quiet. Move.,V
739,LEIA,What do you think youre doing?,V
740,LANDO,Were getting out of here.,V
741,THREEPIO,I knew all along it had to be a mistake.,V
742,LEIA,Do you think that after what you did to Han were going to trust  you?,V
743,LANDO,I had no choice...,V
744,THREEPIO,What are you doing? Trust him trust him!,V
745,LEIA,Oh so we understand dont we Chewie? He had no choice.,V
746,LANDO,Im just trying to help...,V
747,LEIA,We dont need any of your help.,V
748,LANDO,H-a-a-a...,V
749,LEIA,What?,V
750,THREEPIO,It sounds like Han.,V
751,LANDO,Theres still a chance to save Han...I mean at the East  Platform...,V
752,LEIA,Chewie.,V
753,THREEPIO,Im terribly sorry about all this. After all  hes only a Wookiee.,V
754,BOBA,FETT Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.,V
755,THREEPIO,Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?,V
756,THREEPIO,Turn around you wooly...!  Hurry hurry! Were  trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!,V
757,THREEPIO,Well at least your still in one piece! Look what happened  to me!,V
758,THREEPIO,Oh no! Chewie theyre behind you!,V
759,VADER,You have learned much young one.,V
760,LUKE,Youll find Im full of surprises.,V
761,VADER,Your destiny lies with me Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be  true.,V
762,LUKE,No!,V
763,VADER,All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor  thought.,V
764,VADER,Impressive...most impressive.,V
765,VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear...  now release your anger.,V
766,VADER,Only your hatred can destroy me.,V
767,LANDO,The security codes has been changed!,V
768,THREEPIO,Artoo you can tell the computer to override the security  system.,V
769,LANDO,Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes  control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.,V
770,LANDO,This way.,V
771,THREEPIO,Dont blame me. Im an interpreter. Im not supposed to know  a power socket from a computer terminal.,V
772,THREEPIO,What are you talking about? Were not interested in the  hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. Its fixed! Just open the door you stupid lump.,V
773,THREEPIO,I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!,V
774,THREEPIO,Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt Bend down you thoughtless...Ow!,V
775,LANDO,Leia! Go!,V
776,THREEPIO,I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of  course Ive looked better.,V
777,VADER,You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Dont let yourself be  destroyed as Obi-Wan did.,V
778,VADER,There is no escape. Dont make me destroy you. You do not yet  realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.,V
779,LUKE,Ill never join you!,V
780,VADER,If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told  you what happened to your father.,V
781,LUKE,He told me enough! He told me you killed him.,V
782,VADER,No. I am your father.,V
783,LUKE,No. No. Thats not true! Thats impossible!,V
784,VADER,Search your feelings. You know it to be true.,V
785,LUKE,No! No! No!,V
786,VADER,Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is  your destiny. Join me and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. Its the only way.,V
787,LUKE,Ben...Ben please!,V
788,LUKE,Ben. Leia!,V
789,LUKE,Hear me! Leia!,V

812,PIETT,Theyll be in range of our tractor beam in moments lord.,V
813,VADER,Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium  Falcon?,V
814,PIETT,Yes my lord.,V
815,VADER,Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for  stun.,V
816,PIETT,Yes my lord.,V
817,THREEPIO,Noisy brute. Why dont we just go into light-speed?,V
818,THREEPIO,We cant? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?,V
819,THREEPIO,The citys central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo you know  better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what youre doing!,V
820,VADER,Luke.,V
821,LUKE,Father.,V

828,PIETT,Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam.,V
829,THREEPIO,Artoo come back at once! You havent finished with me yet!  You dont know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. Im standing here in pieces and youre having delusions of grandeur!,V

0,SHUTTLE,CAPTAIN Command station this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. Were starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield.,VI
1,DEATH,STAR CONTROLLER The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed.,VI
2,SHUTTLE,CAPTAIN Were starting our approach.,VI
3,OFFICER,Inform the commander that Lord Vaders shuttle has arrived.,VI
4,OPERATOR,Yes sir.,VI
5,JERJERROD,Lord Vader this is an unexpected pleasure.  Were honored by your presence.,VI
6,VADER,You may dispense with the pleasantries Commander. Im here to put you back on schedule.,VI
7,JERJERROD,I assure you Lord Vader my men are working as fast as they can.,VI
8,VADER,Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.,VI
9,JERJERROD,I tell you this station will be operational as planned.,VI
10,VADER,The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.,VI
11,JERJERROD,But he asks the impossible. I need more men.,VI
12,VADER,Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.,VI
13,JERJERROD,The Emperors coming here?,VI
14,VADER,That is correct Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.,VI
15,JERJERROD,We shall double our efforts.,VI
16,VADER,I hope so Commander for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.,VI
17,THREEPIO,Of course Im worried. And you should be too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.,VI
18,THREEPIO,Dont be so sure. If I told you half the things Ive heard about this Jabba the Hutt Youd probably short-circuit.,VI
19,THREEPIO,Artoo are you sure this is the right place? I better knock I suppose.,VI
20,THREEPIO,There doesnt seem to be anyone there. Lets go back and tell Master Luke.,VI

30,THREEPIO,... and a gift.  Gift what gift?,VI
31,BIB,Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.,VI
32,THREEPIO,He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.,VI

39,LUKE,Greetings Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful mighty Jabba and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solos life.  With your wisdom Im sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill I present to you a gift: these two droids.,VI
40,THREEPIO,What did he say?,VI
41,LUKE,... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.,VI
42,THREEPIO,This cant be! Artoo youre playing the wrong message.,VI
43,JABBA,There will be no bargain.,VI
44,THREEPIO,Were doomed.,VI
45,JABBA,I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.,VI
46,THREEPIO,Artoo look! Captain Solo. And hes still frozen in carbonite.,VI
47,THREEPIO,What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!,VI
48,NINEDENINE,Ah good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid are you not?,VI
49,THREEPIO,I am See-Threepio human-cy...,VI
50,NINEDENINE,Yes or no will do.,VI
51,THREEPIO,Oh. Well yes.,VI
52,NINEDENINE,How many languages do you speak?,VI
53,THREEPIO,I am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can readily...,VI
54,NINEDENINE,Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.,VI
55,THREEPIO,Disintegrated?,VI
56,NINEDENINE,Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellencys main audience chamber.,VI
57,THREEPIO,Artoo dont leave me! Ohhh!,VI
58,NINEDENINE,Youre a feisty little one but youll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the masters Sail Barge. And I think youll fit in nicely.,VI

65,THREEPIO,Oh uh yes uh I am here Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!,VI
66,THREEPIO,Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty- five thousand.,VI
67,BOUSHH,I want fifty thousand. No less.,VI
68,THREEPIO,Uh oh... but what what did I say?  Uh the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.,VI
69,THREEPIO,Because hes holding a thermal detonator.,VI
70,JABBA,This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.,VI
71,THREEPIO,Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.,VI
72,BOUSHH,Zeebuss.,VI
73,THREEPIO,He agrees!,VI
74,BOUSHH,Just relax for a moment. Youre free of the carbonite.,VI
75,BOUSHH,Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.,VI
76,HAN,I cant see.,VI
77,BOUSHH,You eyesight will return in time.,VI
78,HAN,Where am I?,VI
79,BOUSHH,Jabbas palace.,VI
80,HAN,Who are you?,VI
81,LEIA,Someone who loves you.,VI

84,HAN,Whats that? I know that laugh.,VI
85,HAN,Hey Jabba. Look Jabba I was just on my way to pay you back but I got a little sidetracked. Its not my fault.,VI
86,JABBA,Its too late for that Solo. You may have been a good smuggler but now youre Bantha fodder.,VI
87,HAN,Look...,VI
88,JABBA,Take him away!,VI
89,HAN,Jabba... Ill pay you triple! Youre throwing away a fortune here. Dont be a fool!,VI
90,JABBA,Bring her to me.,VI

93,LEIA,Ugh!,VI
94,THREEPIO,Ohhh I cant bear to watch.,VI
95,HAN,Chewie? Chewie is that you?,VI
96,HAN,Ah! Chew--Chewie!,VI
97,HAN,Wait. I cant see pal. Whats goin on?,VI
98,HAN,Luke? Lukes crazy. He cant even take care of himself much less rescue anybody.,VI
99,HAN,A...Jedi Knight? I--Im out of it for a little while everybody gets delusions of grandeur.,VI
100,HAN,Im all right pal. Im all right.,VI
101,LUKE,I must speak with Jabba.,VI
102,LUKE,You will take me to Jabba now!,VI
103,LUKE,You serve your master well.,VI
104,LUKE,And you will be rewarded.,VI
105,THREEPIO,At last! Master Lukes come to rescue me.,VI
106,BIB,Master.,VI
107,BIB,...Luke Skywalker Jedi Knight.,VI
108,JABBA,I told you not to admit him.,VI
109,LUKE,I must be allowed to speak.,VI
110,BIB,He must be allowed to speak.,VI
111,JABBA,You weak-minded fool! Hes using an old Jedi mind trick.,VI
112,LUKE,You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.,VI
113,JABBA,Your mind powers will not work on me boy.,VI
114,LUKE,Nevertheless Im taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! Its your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.,VI
115,THREEPIO,Master Luke youre standing on...,VI
116,JABBA,There will be no bargain young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.,VI
117,JABBA,Bascka!,VI
118,THREEPIO,Oh no! The Rancor!,VI

129,THREEPIO,Oh dear. His High Exaltedness the great Jabba the Hutt has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.,VI
130,HAN,Good I hate long waits.,VI
131,THREEPIO,You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.,VI
132,HAN,Doesnt sound so bad.,VI
133,THREEPIO,In his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.,VI
134,HAN,On second thought lets pass on that huh?,VI
135,LUKE,You should have bargained Jabba. Thats the last mistake youll ever make.,VI
136,HAN,I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur I see a big light blur.,VI
137,LUKE,Theres nothing to see. I used to live here you know.,VI
138,HAN,Youre gonna die here you know. Convenient.,VI
139,LUKE,Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. Ive taken care of everything.,VI
140,HAN,Oh... great!,VI
141,JABBA,Soon you will learn to appreciate me.,VI
142,THREEPIO,Oh Im terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?,VI
143,THREEPIO,Well I can see youre serving drinks but this place is dangerous. Theyre going to execute Master Luke and if were not careful us too!,VI
144,THREEPIO,Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.,VI
145,THREEPIO,Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.,VI
146,HAN,Threepio you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth hell get no such pleasure from us. Right?,VI
147,LUKE,Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.,VI

179,LEIA,Thats all any of us can see.,VI
180,HAN,Then I guess Im getting better.,VI
181,HAN,Ive got to hand it to you kid you were pretty good out there.,VI
182,LUKE,I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.,VI
183,HAN,No Im thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasnt just sleepin. It was a big wide awake nothing!,VI
184,LUKE,Ill see you back at the fleet.,VI
185,HAN,Why dont you leave that crate and come with us?,VI
186,LUKE,I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.,VI
187,HAN,Guess I owe you some thanks too Lando.,VI
188,LANDO,Figured if I left you frozen like that youd just give me bad luck the rest of my life so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.,VI
189,LEIA,He means Youre welcome.,VI
190,LANDO,Come on lets get off this miserable dust ball.,VI
191,LUKE,Ill meet you back at the fleet.,VI
192,LEIA,Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.,VI
193,LUKE,I will.,VI
194,HAN,Hey Luke thanks. Thanks for comin after me. Now I owe you one.,VI
195,LUKE,Thats right Artoo. Were going to the  Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep...  to an old friend.,VI
196,EMPEROR,Rise my friend.,VI
197,VADER,The Death Star will be completed on schedule.,VI
198,EMPEROR,You have done well Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.,VI
199,VADER,Yes my Master.,VI
200,EMPEROR,Patience my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.,VI
201,VADER,As you wish.,VI
202,EMPEROR,Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.,VI
203,YODA,Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?,VI
204,LUKE,No... of course not.,VI
205,YODA,I do yes I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak.  When nine hundred years old you reach look as good you will not. Hmm?,VI
206,YODA,Soon will I rest. Yes forever sleep. Earned it I have.,VI
207,LUKE,Master Yoda you cant die.,VI
208,YODA,Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.,VI
209,LUKE,But I need your help. Ive come back to complete the training.,VI
210,YODA,No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.,VI
211,LUKE,Then I am a Jedi?,VI
212,YODA,Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then only then a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.,VI
213,LUKE,Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?,VI
214,YODA,Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.,VI
215,LUKE,Yoda I must know.,VI
216,YODA,Your father he is.,VI
217,YODA,Told you did he?,VI
218,LUKE,Yes.,VI
219,YODA,Unexpected this is and unfortunate..,VI
220,LUKE,Unfortunate that I know the truth?,VI
221,YODA,No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.,VI
222,LUKE,Well Im sorry.,VI
223,YODA,Remember a Jedis strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger fear aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny.,VI
224,YODA,Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor or suffer your fathers fate you will. Luke when gone am I  the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned Luke...  There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker.,VI
225,LUKE,I cant do it Artoo. I cant go on alone.,VI
226,BEN,Yoda will always be with you.,VI
227,LUKE,Obi-Wan! Why didnt you tell me?,VI
228,LUKE,You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.,VI
229,BEN,You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.,VI
230,LUKE,A certain point of view!,VI
231,BEN,Luke youre going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.,VI
232,BEN,I dont blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did it certainly wouldnt have been for the first time. You see what happened to your father was my fault.,VI
233,BEN,Anakin was a good friend.,VI
234,BEN,When I first knew him your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.,VI
235,LUKE,Theres still good in him.,VI
236,BEN,I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldnt be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.,VI
237,LUKE,I cant do it Ben.,VI
238,BEN,You cannot escape your destiny.,VI
239,LUKE,I tried to stop him once. I couldnt do it.,VI
240,BEN,Vader humbled you when first you met him Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you among other things the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.,VI
241,LUKE,But I had to help my friends.,VI
242,BEN,And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely I fear.,VI
243,LUKE,I found out Darth Vader was my father.,VI
244,BEN,To be a Jedi Luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldnt get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you like your father. Only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door and you have held firm. Youre no longer so reckless now Luke. You are strong and patient. And now you must face Darth Vader again!,VI
245,LUKE,I cant kill my own father.,VI
246,BEN,Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.,VI
247,LUKE,Yoda spoke of another.,VI
248,BEN,The other he spoke of is your twin sister.,VI
249,LUKE,But I have no sister.,VI
250,BEN,Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew as I did if Anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.,VI
251,LUKE,Leia! Leias my sister.,VI
252,BEN,Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.,VI
253,BEN,When your father left he didnt know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa on Alderaan.,VI
254,BEN,The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew shed been adopted of course. But it was a title without real power since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so the family continued to be politically powerful and Leia following in her foster fathers path became a senator as well.  Thats not all she became of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  Thats what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine if her troubles became desperate.,VI
255,LUKE,But you cant let her get involved now Ben. Vader will destroy her.,VI
256,BEN,She hasnt been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have Luke ... but the Force is strong with her as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!,VI
257,HAN,Well look at you a general huh?,VI
258,LANDO,Oh well someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.,VI
259,HAN,Well dont look at me pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didnt know they were lookin for somebody to lead this crazy attack.,VI
260,LANDO,Im surprised they didnt ask you to do it.,VI
261,HAN,Well who says they didnt.  But I aint crazy. Youre the respectable one remember?,VI
262,MON,MOTHMA The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.,VI
263,MON,MOTHMA The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperors new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all weve learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.,VI
264,MON,MOTHMA Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar please.,VI
265,ACKBAR,You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down our cruisers will create a perimeter while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.,VI
266,ACKBAR,General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack,VI
267,HAN,Good luck.,VI
268,HAN,Youre gonna need it.,VI
269,ACKBAR,General Madine.,VI
270,GENERAL,MADINE We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship and using a secret Imperial code a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.,VI
271,THREEPIO,Sounds dangerous.,VI
272,LEIA,I wonder who they found to pull that off.,VI
273,GENERAL,MADINE General Solo is your strike team assembled?,VI
274,HAN,Uh my teams ready. I dont have a command crew for the shuttle.,VI
275,HAN,Well its gonna be rough pal. I didnt want to speak for you.,VI
276,HAN,Thats one.,VI
277,LEIA,Uh General... count me in.,VI
278,VOICE,Im with you too!,VI
279,LEIA,What is it?,VI
280,LUKE,Ask me again sometime.,VI
281,HAN,Luke.,VI
282,LUKE,Hi Han... Chewie.,VI
283,THREEPIO,Exciting is hardly the word I would use.,VI
284,HAN,Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. Shes the fastest ship in the fleet.,VI
285,LANDO,All right old buddy. You know I know what she means to you. Ill take good care of her. She-she wont get a scratch. All right?,VI
286,HAN,Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.,VI
287,LANDO,Look would you get going you pirate.,VI
288,LANDO,Good luck.,VI
289,HAN,You too.,VI
290,HAN,You got her warmed?,VI
291,LUKE,Yeah shes comin up.,VI
292,HAN,No. I dont think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her Chewie.,VI
293,LEIA,Hey are you awake?,VI
294,HAN,Yeah I just got a funny feeling. Like Im not gonna see her again.,VI
295,LEIA,Come on General lets move.,VI
296,HAN,Right. Chewie lets see what this piece of junk can do. Ready everybody?,VI
297,LUKE,All set.,VI
298,THREEPIO,Here we go again.,VI
299,HAN,All right hang on.,VI
300,VADER,What is thy bidding my Master?,VI
301,EMPEROR,Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.,VI
302,VADER,What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?,VI
303,EMPEROR,It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.,VI
304,VADER,Yes my Master.,VI
305,HAN,If they dont go for this were gonna have to get outta here pretty quick Chewie.,VI
306,CONTROLLER,We have you on our screen now. Please identify.,VI
307,HAN,Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.,VI
308,CONTROLLER,Shuttle Tydirium transmit the clearance code for shield passage.,VI
309,HAN,Transmission commencing.,VI
310,LEIA,Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.,VI
311,HAN,Itll work. Itll work.,VI
312,LUKE,Vaders on that ship.,VI
313,HAN,Now dont get jittery Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though Chewie but dont look like youre trying to keep your distance.,VI
314,HAN,I dont know.  Fly casual.,VI
315,LUKE,Im endangering the mission. I shouldnt have come.,VI
316,HAN,Its your imagination kid. Come on. Lets keep a little optimism here.,VI
317,VADER,Where is that shuttle going?,VI
318,PIETT,Shuttle Tydirium what is your cargo and destination?,VI
319,PILOT,VOICE Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.,VI
320,VADER,Do they have a code clearance?,VI
321,PIETT,Its an older code sir but it checks out. I was about to clear them.,VI
322,PIETT,Shall I hold them?,VI
323,VADER,No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.,VI
324,PIETT,As you wish my lord.  Carry on.,VI
325,HAN,Theyre not goin for it Chewie.,VI
326,CONTROLLER,Shuttle Tydirium deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course.,VI
327,HAN,Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.,VI
328,THREEPIO,Oh I told you it was dangerous here.,VI
329,LEIA,Shall we try and go around?,VI
330,HAN,Itll take time. This whole partyll be for nothing if they see us.,VI
331,HAN,Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.,VI
332,LUKE,Quietly there might be more of them out there.,VI
333,HAN,Hey... its me.,VI
334,SCOUT,#1 Go for help! Go!,VI
335,LUKE,Great. Come on.,VI
336,LEIA,Over there! Two more of them!,VI

344,THREEPIO,Oh General Solo somebodys coming. Oh!,VI
345,HAN,Luke! Wheres Leia?,VI
346,LUKE,What? She didnt come back?,VI
347,HAN,I thought she was with you.,VI
348,LUKE,We got separated.,VI
349,LUKE,Hey we better go look for her.,VI
350,HAN,Take the squad ahead.  Well meet at the shield generator at 0300.,VI
351,LUKE,Come on Artoo.  Well need your scanners.,VI
352,THREEPIO,Dont worry Master Luke.  We know what to do.,VI
353,THREEPIO,And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!,VI
354,LEIA,Cut it out!,VI
355,LEIA,Im not gonna hurt you.,VI
356,LEIA,Well looks like Im stuck here. Trouble is I dont know where here is.,VI
357,LEIA,Well maybe you can help me. Come on sit down.,VI
358,LEIA,I promise I wont hurt you. Now come here.,VI
359,LEIA,All right. You want something to eat?,VI
360,LEIA,Thats right. Come on. Hmmm?,VI
361,LEIA,Look its a hat. Its not gonna hurt you. Look. Youre a jittery little thing arent you?,VI
362,LEIA,What is it?,VI
363,SCOUT,#l Freeze!  Come on get up!,VI
364,SCOUT,#1 Go get your ride and take her back to base.,VI
365,SCOUT,#2 Yes sir.,VI
366,LEIA,Come on lets get outta here.,VI
367,GUARD,Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.,VI
368,VADER,The Emperor will see me now!,VI
369,GUARD,The Emperor will see you now.,VI
370,EMPEROR,I told you to remain on the command ship.,VI
371,VADER,A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.,VI
372,EMPEROR,Yes I know.,VI
373,VADER,My son is with them.,VI
374,EMPEROR,Are you sure?,VI
375,VADER,I have felt him my Master.,VI
376,EMPEROR,Strange that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear Lord Vader.,VI
377,VADER,They are clear my Master.,VI
378,EMPEROR,Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.,VI
379,VADER,He will come to me?,VI
380,EMPEROR,I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you and then you will bring him before me.,VI
381,VADER,As you wish.,VI
382,HAN,Luke! Luke!,VI
383,THREEPIO,Oh Master Luke.,VI
384,LUKE,Theres two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.,VI
385,THREEPIO,Im afraid that Artoos sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.,VI
386,HAN,I hope shes alright.,VI
387,HAN,What Chewie? What? Chewie!,VI
388,HAN,Hey I dont get it.,VI
389,HAN,Nah its just a dead animal Chewie.,VI
390,LUKE,Chewie wa-wait!  Dont!,VI
391,HAN,Nice work. Great Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.,VI
392,LUKE,Will you take it easy? Lets just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han can you reach my lightsaber?,VI
393,HAN,Yeah sure.,VI
394,THREEPIO,Artoo Im not sure thats such a good idea. Its a very long dro-o-op!!,VI
395,HAN,Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.,VI
396,HAN,Hey!,VI
397,LUKE,Han dont. Itll be all right.,VI
398,LUKE,Chewie give em your crossbow.,VI
399,THREEPIO,Oh my head. Oh my goodness!,VI
400,LUKE,Do you understand anything theyre saying?,VI
401,THREEPIO,Oh yes Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication.,VI
402,HAN,What are you telling them?,VI
403,THREEPIO,Hello I think... I could be mistaken. Theyre using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.,VI
404,HAN,Well why dont you use your divine influence and get us out of this?,VI
405,THREEPIO,I beg your pardon General Solo but that just wouldnt be proper.,VI
406,HAN,Proper?!,VI
407,THREEPIO,Its against my programming to impersonate a deity.,VI
408,HAN,Why you--,VI
409,HAN,My mistake. Hes an old friend of mine.,VI
410,HAN,I have a really bad feeling about this.,VI
411,HAN,What did he say?,VI
412,THREEPIO,Im rather embarrassed General Solo but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.,VI
413,HAN,and LUKE Leia!,VI
414,LEIA,Oh!,VI
415,THREEPIO,Your Royal Highness.,VI
416,LEIA,But these are my friends. Threepio tell them they must be set free.,VI
417,HAN,Somehow I got the feeling that didnt help us very much.,VI
418,LUKE,Threepio tell them if they dont do as you wish youll become angry and use your magic.,VI
419,THREEPIO,But Master Luke what magic? couldnt possibly --,VI
420,LUKE,Just tell them.,VI
421,THREEPIO,You see Master Luke; they didnt believe me. Just...,VI
422,THREEPIO,... as I said they wouldnt. Wha-wha-whats happening! Oh! Oh dear! Oh!,VI
423,THREEPIO,Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody somebody help! Master Luke Artoo! Artoo quickly! Do something somebody! Oh! Ohhh!,VI
424,THREEPIO,Oh oh oh oh! Thank goodness.,VI
425,LUKE,Thanks Threepio.,VI
426,THREEPIO,I...I never knew I had it in me.,VI
427,THREEPIO,Yes Artoo. I was just coming to that.,VI
428,HAN,Whats going on?,VI
429,LEIA,I dont know.,VI
430,THREEPIO,Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.,VI
431,HAN,Just what I always wanted.,VI
432,HAN,Well short help is better than no help at all Chewie.  Thank you. Okay.,VI
433,THREEPIO,He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.,VI
434,HAN,Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies too. And try and get our weapons back.,VI
435,HAN,And hurry up will ya? I havent got all day.,VI
436,LUKE,Luke whats wrong?,VI
437,LUKE,Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?,VI
438,LEIA,Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.,VI
439,LUKE,What do you remember?,VI
440,LEIA,Just...images really. Feelings.,VI
441,LUKE,Tell me.,VI
442,LEIA,She was very beautiful. Kind but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?,VI
443,LUKE,I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.,VI
444,LEIA,Luke tell me. Whats troubling you?,VI
445,LUKE,Vader is here...now on this moon.,VI
446,LEIA,How do you know?,VI
447,LUKE,I felt his presence. Hes come for me. He can feel when Im near. Thats why I have to go.  As long as I stay Im endangering the group and our mission here.  I have to face him.,VI
448,LEIA,Why?,VI
449,LUKE,Hes my father.,VI
450,LEIA,Your father?,VI
451,LUKE,Theres more. It wont be easy for you to hear it but you must. If I dont make it back youre the only hope for the Alliance.,VI
452,LEIA,Luke dont talk that way. You have a power I--I dont understand and could never have.,VI
453,LUKE,Youre wrong Leia. You have that power too. In time youll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.,VI
454,LUKE,Yes. Its you Leia.,VI
455,LEIA,I know. Somehow...Ive always known.,VI
456,LUKE,Then you know why I have to face him.,VI
457,LEIA,No! Luke run away far away. If he can feel your presence then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.,VI
458,LUKE,No you dont. Youve always been strong.,VI
459,LEIA,But why must you confront him?,VI
460,LUKE,Because...there is good in him. Ive felt it. He wont turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.,VI
461,HAN,Hey whats goin on?,VI
462,LEIA,Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.,VI
463,HAN,Nothing?  Come on tell me.  Whats goin on?,VI
464,LEIA,I...I cant tell you.,VI
465,HAN,Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?,VI
466,LEIA,I...,VI
467,HAN,Ahhh...,VI
468,HAN,Im sorry.,VI
469,LEIA,Hold me.,VI
470,COMMANDER,This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it I believe there may be more of them and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area.,VI
471,COMMANDER,He was armed only with this.,VI
472,VADER,Good work Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me.,VI
473,COMMANDER,Yes my Lord.,VI
474,VADER,The Emperor has been expecting you.,VI
475,LUKE,I know father.,VI
476,VADER,So you have accepted the truth.,VI
477,LUKE,Ive accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker my father.,VI
478,VADER,That name no longer has any meaning for me.,VI
479,LUKE,It is the name of your true self. Youve only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasnt driven it from you fully. That is why you couldnt destroy me. Thats why you wont bring me to your Emperor now.,VI
480,VADER,I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.,VI
481,VADER,Your skills are complete. Indeed you are powerful as the Emperor has foreseen.,VI
482,LUKE,Come with me.,VI
483,VADER,Obi-Wan once thought as you do.,VI
484,VADER,You dont know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.,VI
485,LUKE,I will not turn...and youll be forced to kill me.,VI
486,VADER,If that is your destiny.,VI
487,LUKE,Search your feelings father. You cant do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.,VI
488,VADER,It is too late for me son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.,VI
489,LUKE,Then my father is truly dead.,VI
490,LEIA,The main entrance to the control bunkers on the far side of that landing platform. This isnt gonna be easy.,VI
491,HAN,Hey dont worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.,VI
492,LEIA,Whats he saying?,VI
493,THREEPIO,He says theres a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.,VI
494,LANDO,Admiral were in position. All fighters accounted for.,VI
495,ACKBAR,Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.,VI
496,LANDO,Dont worry my friends are down there. Theyll have that shield down on time... or thisll be the shortest offensive of all time.,VI
497,ACKBAR,All craft prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.,VI
498,LANDO,All right. Stand by.,VI
499,HAN,Back door huh? Good idea.,VI
500,HAN,Its only a few guards. This shouldnt be too much trouble.,VI
501,LEIA,Well it only takes one to sound the alarm.,VI
502,HAN,Then well do it real quiet-like.,VI
503,THREEPIO,Oh! Oh my. Uh Princess Leia!,VI
504,LEIA,Quiet.,VI
505,THREEPIO,Im afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.,VI
506,LEIA,Oh no.,VI
507,HAN,There goes our surprise attack.,VI
508,SCOUT,Look! Over there! Stop him!,VI
509,HAN,Not bad for a little furball. Theres only one left. You stay here. Well take care of this.,VI
510,THREEPIO,I have decided that we shall stay here.,VI
511,EMPEROR,Welcome young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.,VI
512,EMPEROR,You no longer need those.,VI
513,EMPEROR,Guards leave us.,VI
514,EMPEROR,Im looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master.,VI
515,LUKE,Youre gravely mistaken. You wont convert me as you did my father.,VI
516,EMPEROR,Oh no my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.,VI
517,VADER,His lightsaber.,VI
518,EMPEROR,Ah yes a Jedis weapon. Much like your fathers. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you.,VI
519,LUKE,Youre wrong. Soon Ill be dead...and you with me.,VI
520,EMPEROR,Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.,VI
521,EMPEROR,Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.,VI
522,LUKE,Your overconfidence is your weakness.,VI
523,EMPEROR,Your faith in your friends is yours.,VI
524,VADER,It is pointless to resist my son.,VI
525,EMPEROR,Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design.  Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...,VI
526,EMPEROR,...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.,VI
527,EMPEROR,Oh...Im afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.,VI
528,HAN,All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly Chewie.,VI
529,LEIA,Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.,VI
530,HAN,Charges!  Come on come on!,VI

537,GREEN,LEADER Green Leader standing by.,VI
538,WEDGE,Lock S-foils in attack positions.,VI
539,ACKBAR,May the Force be with us.,VI
540,LANDO,Weve got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield up or down. Well how could they be jamming us if they dont know if were coming.,VI
541,LANDO,Break off the attack! The shield is still up.,VI
542,RED,LEADER I get no reading. Are you sure?,VI
543,LANDO,Pull up! All craft pull up!,VI
544,ACKBAR,Take evasive action! Green Group stick close to holding sector MV-7.,VI
545,CONTROLLER,Admiral we have enemy ships in sector 47.,VI
546,ACKBAR,Its a trap!,VI
547,LANDO,Fighters coming in.,VI
548,REBEL,PILOT Theres too many of them!,VI
549,LANDO,Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.,VI
550,WEDGE,Copy Gold Leader.,VI
551,EMPEROR,Come boy. See for yourself.,VI
552,EMPEROR,From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance and the end of your insignificant Rebellion.,VI
553,EMPEROR,You want this dont you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment you make yourself more my servant.,VI
554,LUKE,No!,VI
555,EMPEROR,It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You like your father are now mine!,VI
556,STORMTROOPER,All right move it! I said move it! Go on!,VI
557,THREEPIO,Hello! I say over there! Were you looking for me?,VI
558,BUNKER,COMMANDER Bring those two down here!,VI
559,STORMTROOPER,Lets go!,VI
560,THREEPIO,Well theyre on their way. Artoo are you sure this was a good idea?,VI
561,STORMTROOPER,Freeze! Dont move!,VI
562,THREEPIO,We surrender.,VI
563,THREEPIO,Ohhh! Stand back Artoo.,VI
564,LEIA,The codes changed. We need Artoo!,VI
565,HAN,Heres the terminal.,VI
566,LEIA,Artoo where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.,VI
567,THREEPIO,Going? What do you mean youre going. But-- but going where Artoo? No what! Artoo! Oh this is no time for heroics. Come back!,VI

572,WEDGE,Cut to the left! Ill take the leader! Theyre heading for the medical frigate.,VI
573,NAVIGATOR,Pressures steady.,VI
574,LANDO,Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for.,VI
575,COMMANDER,Were in attack position now sir.,VI
576,PIETT,Hold here.,VI
577,COMMANDER,Were not going to attack?,VI
578,PIETT,I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.,VI
579,EMPEROR,As you can see my young apprentice your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station.  Fire at will Commander.,VI

581,LANDO,That blast came from the Death Star! That things operational!  Home One this is Gold Leader.,VI
582,ACKBAR,We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.,VI
583,LANDO,You wont get another chance at this Admiral.,VI
584,ACKBAR,We have no choice General Calrissian. Our cruisers cant repel firepower of that magnitude.,VI
585,LANDO,Han will have that shield down. Weve got to give him more time.,VI
586,THREEPIO,Were coming!,VI
587,HAN,Come on! Come on!,VI
588,THREEPIO,Oh Artoo hurry!,VI
589,THREEPIO,My goodness! Artoo why did you have to be so brave?,VI
590,HAN,Well I suppose I could hotwire this thing.,VI
591,LEIA,Ill cover you.,VI
592,LANDO,Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point- blank range.,VI
593,ACKBAR,At that close range we wont last long against those Star Destroyers.,VI
594,LANDO,Well last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.,VI
595,REBEL,PILOT Shes gonna blow!,VI
596,Y-WING,PILOT Im hit!,VI
597,EMPEROR,Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends.,VI
598,EMPEROR,Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.,VI

612,HAN,Chewie!  Get down here!  Shes wounded!  No wait....  I got an idea.,VI
613,EMPEROR,Good.  Use your aggressive feelings boy!  Let the hate flow through you.,VI
614,VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well.,VI
615,LUKE,I will not fight you father.,VI
616,VADER,You are unwise to lower your defenses.,VI
617,LUKE,Your thoughts betray you father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.,VI
618,VADER,There is no conflict.,VI
619,LUKE,You couldnt bring yourself to kill me before and I dont believe youll destroy me now.,VI
620,VADER,You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight then you will meet your destiny.,VI

633,VADER,Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side then perhaps she will.,VI
634,LUKE,Never-r-r!,VI
635,EMPEROR,Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now fulfill your destiny and take your fathers place at my side!,VI
636,LUKE,Never! Ill never turn to the dark side. Youve failed Your Highness. I am a Jedi like my father before me.,VI

642,EMPEROR,Young fool...only now at the end do you understand.,VI

644,LUKE,Father please. Help me.,VI
645,EMPEROR,Now young Skywalker...you will die.,VI
646,WEDGE,Im going in.,VI

649,WEDGE,Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.,VI
650,LANDO,Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you.,VI
651,PILOT,Copy Gold Leader.,VI
652,LANDO,That was too close.,VI
653,ACKBAR,Weve got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.,VI
