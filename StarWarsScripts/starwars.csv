0,THREEPIO,Did you hear that?  They've shut down the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed for sure.  This is madness!,IV
1,THREEPIO,We're doomed!,IV
2,THREEPIO,There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.,IV
3,THREEPIO,What's that?,IV
4,THREEPIO,I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...,IV
5,LUKE,Hurry up!  Come with me!  What are you waiting for?!  Get in gear!,IV
6,THREEPIO,"Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?",IV
7,THREEPIO,At last!  Where have you been?,IV
8,THREEPIO,They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?  We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!,IV
9,THREEPIO,"Wait a minute, where are you going?",IV
10,IMPERIAL,"OFFICER"" ""The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.",IV
11,VADER,Where are those transmissions you intercepted?,IV
12,REBEL,"OFFICER"" ""We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.",IV
13,VADER,If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?,IV
14,VADER,"Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.  I want her alive!",IV
15,TROOPER,There she is! Set for stun!,IV
16,TROOPER,She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.,IV
17,THREEPIO,"Hey, you're not permitted in there.  It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..",IV
18,THREEPIO,"Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!  Now come out before somebody sees you.",IV
19,THREEPIO,Secret mission?  What plans?  What are you talking about?  I'm not getting in there!,IV
20,THREEPIO,I'm going to regret this.,IV
21,CHIEF,"PILOT"" ""There goes another one.",IV
22,CAPTAIN,Hold your fire.  There are no life forms.  It must have been short-circuited.,IV
23,THREEPIO,"That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.",IV
24,THREEPIO,Are you sure this things safe?,IV
25,WOMAN,I've told you kids to slow down!,IV
26,FIXER,Did I hear a young noise blast through here?,IV
27,CAMIE,It was just Wormie on another rampage.,IV
28,LUKE,Shape it up you guys!...  Biggs?,IV
29,LUKE,I didn't know you were back!  When did you get in?,IV
30,BIGGS,"Just now.  I wanted to surprise you, hot shot.  I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working. ",IV
31,LUKE,"The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon?  Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?",IV
32,BIGGS,Of course I got it.  Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.  First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.,IV
33,LUKE,I almost forgot.  There's a battle going on!  Right here in our system.  Come and look!,IV
34,DEAK,Not again!  Forget it.,IV
35,LUKE,There they are!,IV
36,BIGGS,"That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there!  Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.",IV
37,LUKE,But there was a lot of firing earlier...,IV
38,LUKE,"Hey, easy with those...",IV
39,CAMIE,"Don't worry about it, Wormie.",IV
40,FIXER,"I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here.  I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system.  Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...",IV
41,LEIA,"Lord Vader, I should have known.  Only you could be so bold.  The Imperial Senate will not sit stillfor this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...",IV
42,VADER,"Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.",IV
43,LEIA,I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...,IV
44,VADER,You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.  Take her away!,IV
45,COMMANDER,"Holding her is dangerous.  If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.",IV
46,VADER,I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!,IV
47,COMMANDER,you anything.,IV
48,VADER,Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!,IV
49,SECOND,"OFFICER"" ""Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.",IV
50,VADER,"She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time.",IV
51,COMMANDER,"Yes, sir.",IV
52,THREEPIO,How did I get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.,IV
53,THREEPIO,I've got to rest before I fall apart.  My joints are almost frozen. ,IV
54,THREEPIO,What a desolate place this is.,IV
55,THREEPIO,Where are you going?,IV
56,THREEPIO,"Well, I'm not going that way.  It's much too rocky.  This way is much easier.",IV
57,THREEPIO,What makes you think there are settlements over there?,IV
58,THREEPIO,Don't get technical with me.,IV
59,THREEPIO,"What mission?  What are you talking about?  I've had just about enough of you!  Go that way!  You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!",IV
60,THREEPIO,"And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.",IV
61,THREEPIO,No more adventures.  I'm not going that way.,IV
62,THREEPIO,"That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.",IV
63,THREEPIO,"Wait, what's that?  A transport!  I'm saved!",IV
64,THREEPIO,"Over here!  Help!  Please, help!",IV
65,LUKE,"... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.  I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic.",IV
66,BIGGS,"You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.",IV
67,LUKE,Look who's talking.  Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...,IV
68,BIGGS,I've missed you kid.,IV
69,LUKE,"Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.  It's been so...quiet.",IV
70,BIGGS,"Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.",IV
71,LUKE,What are you talking about?,IV
72,BIGGS,"I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...",IV
73,LUKE,Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?,IV
74,BIGGS,Quiet down will ya!  You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!,IV
75,LUKE,I'm sorry.  I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...,IV
76,BIGGS,My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.,IV
77,LUKE,around forever trying to find them.,IV
78,BIGGS,"I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...  It's what we always talked about.  Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in. ",IV
79,LUKE,And I'm stuck here...,IV
80,BIGGS,I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  You'll get your chance to get off this rock.,IV
81,LUKE,Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.,IV
82,BIGGS,Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.,IV
83,LUKE,"I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season.  I can't leave him now.",IV
84,BIGGS,"I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.  What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...  You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.",IV
85,LUKE,It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire won't bother with this rock.,IV
86,BIGGS,Things always change.,IV
87,LUKE,I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long? ,IV
88,BIGGS,"No, I'm leaving in the morning...",IV
89,LUKE,Then I guess I won't see you.,IV
90,BIGGS,Maybe someday...  I'll keep a lookout.,IV
91,LUKE,"Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...  Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.",IV
92,BIGGS,"So long, Luke.",IV
93,THREEPIO,Artoo-Detoo!  It's you!  It's you!,IV
94,FIRST,"TROOPER"" ""Someone was in the pod.  The tracks go off in this direction. ",IV
95,SECOND,"TROOPER"" ""Look, sir - droids.",IV
96,THREEPIO,Wake up!  Wake up!,IV
97,THREEPIO,We're doomed.,IV
98,THREEPIO,Do you think they'll melt us down?,IV
99,THREEPIO,Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  Will this never end?,IV
100,BERU,"Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.",IV
101,LUKE,It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.,IV
102,OWEN,I have no need for a protocol droid.,IV
103,THREEPIO,Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...,IV
104,OWEN,What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.,IV
105,THREEPIO,Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...,IV
106,OWEN,Do you speak Bocce?,IV
107,THREEPIO,"Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce...",IV
108,OWEN,All right; shut up! I'll take this one.,IV
109,THREEPIO,"Shutting up, sir.",IV
110,OWEN,"Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.",IV
111,LUKE,But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...,IV
112,OWEN,"You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now, come on, get to it!",IV
113,LUKE,"All right, come on!  And the red one, come on.  Well, come on, Red, let's go.",IV
114,LUKE,Uncle Owen...,IV
115,OWEN,Yeah?,IV
116,LUKE,This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look!,IV
117,OWEN,"Hey, what're you trying to push on us?",IV
118,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.",IV
119,LUKE,Uncle Owen...,IV
120,OWEN,Yeah?,IV
121,LUKE,What about that one?,IV
122,OWEN,What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.,IV
123,LUKE,"Yeah, take it away.",IV
124,THREEPIO,"Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition.  I've worked with him before.  Here he comes.",IV
125,LUKE,"Okay, let's go.",IV
126,THREEPIO,"Now, don't forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!",IV
127,THREEPIO,"Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!",IV
128,LUKE,"It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!",IV
129,THREEPIO,Is there anything I might do to help? ,IV
130,LUKE,"Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!",IV
131,THREEPIO,"I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.",IV
132,LUKE,"Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.",IV
133,THREEPIO,"I see, sir.",IV
134,LUKE,"Uh, you can call me Luke.",IV
135,THREEPIO,"I see, sir Luke.",IV
136,LUKE,Just Luke.,IV
137,THREEPIO,"And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.",IV
138,LUKE,Hello.,IV
139,LUKE,You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.,IV
140,THREEPIO,"With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.",IV
141,LUKE,You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?,IV
142,THREEPIO,"That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.",IV
143,LUKE,Have you been in many battles?,IV
144,THREEPIO,"Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.  Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.",IV
145,LUKE,"Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...",IV
146,LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You'remy only hope.",IV
147,LUKE,What's this?,IV
148,THREEPIO,What is what?!?  He asked you a question...What is that?,IV
149,LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.",IV
150,THREEPIO,"Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind.",IV
151,LUKE,Who is she?  She's beautiful.,IV
152,THREEPIO,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.",IV
153,LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...",IV
154,THREEPIO,"I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...",IV
155,LUKE,Is there more to this recording?,IV
156,THREEPIO,"Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble.  It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master.",IV
157,THREEPIO,"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.",IV
158,LUKE,Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?,IV
159,THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?",IV
160,LUKE,"Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit.",IV
161,LUKE,I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.,IV
162,THREEPIO,"He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.",IV
163,LUKE,"H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay.",IV
164,LUKE,There you go.,IV
165,LUKE,"Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.",IV
166,THREEPIO,been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! ,IV
167,AUNT,"BERU"" ""Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!",IV
168,LUKE,"All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.",IV
169,THREEPIO,"I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.",IV
170,LUKE,"Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.",IV
171,THREEPIO,Just you reconsider playing that message for him.,IV
172,THREEPIO,"No, I don't think he likes you at all.",IV
173,THREEPIO,"No, I don't like you either.",IV
174,LUKE,"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.",IV
175,OWEN,What makes you think that?,IV
176,LUKE,"Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.",IV
177,LUKE,"I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.",IV
178,OWEN,That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.,IV
179,LUKE,But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?,IV
180,OWEN,"He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.",IV
181,LUKE,He knew my father?,IV
182,OWEN,I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.,IV
183,LUKE,"Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.",IV
184,OWEN,You mean the next semester before harvest?,IV
185,LUKE,"Sure, there're more than enough droids.",IV
186,OWEN,Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season.  This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year.,IV
187,OWEN,"You must understand I need you here, Luke.",IV
188,LUKE,But it's a whole 'nother year.,IV
189,OWEN,"Look, it's only one more season.",IV
190,LUKE,"Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.",IV
191,AUNT,"BERU"" ""Where are you going?",IV
192,LUKE,It looks like I'm going nowhere.  I have to finish cleaning those droids.,IV
193,AUNT,"BERU"" ""Owen, he can't stay here forever.  Most of his friends have gone.  It means so much to him.",IV
194,OWEN,I'll make it up to him next year.  I promise.,IV
195,AUNT,"BERU"" ""Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.",IV
196,OWEN,That's what I'm afraid of.,IV
197,LUKE,What are you doing hiding there?,IV
198,THREEPIO,"It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.",IV
199,LUKE,"Oh, no!",IV
200,THREEPIO,That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times. ,IV
201,LUKE,How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!,IV
202,THREEPIO,"Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?",IV
203,LUKE,It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.,IV
204,OWEN,"Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.",IV
205,LUKE,"All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it.",IV
206,LUKE,You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.,IV
207,THREEPIO,"Oh, he excels at that, sir.",IV
208,OWEN,Luke?  Luke?  Luke?  Where could he be loafing now!,IV
209,OWEN,Have you seen Luke this morning?,IV
210,AUNT,"BERU"" ""He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.",IV
211,OWEN,Uh?  Did he take those two new droids with him?,IV
212,AUNT,"BERU"" ""I think so.",IV
213,OWEN,"Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!",IV
214,LUKE,How's that.,IV
215,LUKE,"Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.",IV
216,THREEPIO,"Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.",IV
217,LUKE,Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...,IV
218,THREEPIO,"Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...",IV
219,LUKE,"Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.",IV
220,LUKE,"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?",IV
221,THREEPIO,"Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.",IV
222,LUKE,"Well, come on. It's getting late.  I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.",IV
223,THREEPIO,"If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.",IV
224,LUKE,"No, he's not going to try anything.",IV
225,LUKE,What's wrong with him now?,IV
226,THREEPIO,"Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.",IV
227,LUKE,"Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on, let's have a look.  Come on.",IV
228,LUKE,"There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.",IV
229,BEN,Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.,IV
230,BEN,"Don't worry, he'll be all right.",IV
231,LUKE,What happened?,IV
232,BEN,"Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.",IV
233,LUKE,"Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy, am I glad to see you! ",IV
234,BEN,"The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?",IV
235,LUKE,"Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?  Do you know who he's talking about?",IV
236,BEN,Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.,IV
237,LUKE,I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.,IV
238,BEN,"Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.",IV
239,LUKE,You know him!,IV
240,BEN,"Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.",IV
241,LUKE,Then the droid does belong to you.,IV
242,BEN,Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting... ,IV
243,BEN,I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.,IV
244,LUKE,... Threepio!,IV
245,THREEPIO,Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...,IV
246,LUKE,Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.,IV
247,THREEPIO,"I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.",IV
248,LUKE,"No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?",IV
249,BEN,"Quickly, son... they're on the move.",IV
250,LUKE,"No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.",IV
251,BEN,That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.,IV
252,LUKE,You fought in the Clone Wars?,IV
253,BEN,"Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.",IV
254,LUKE,I wish I'd known him.,IV
255,BEN,"He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me...",IV
256,BEN,"I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. ",IV
257,THREEPIO,"Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.",IV
258,LUKE,"Sure, go ahead.",IV
259,LUKE,What is it?,IV
260,BEN,Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.,IV
261,BEN,"An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.",IV
262,LUKE,How did my father die?,IV
263,BEN,"A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.",IV
264,LUKE,The Force?,IV
265,BEN,"Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together.",IV
266,BEN,"Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from.",IV
267,LUKE,I saw part of the message he was...,IV
268,BEN,I seem to have found it.,IV
269,LEIA,"General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.",IV
270,BEN,You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.,IV
271,LUKE,"Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is.",IV
272,BEN,"I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help.",IV
273,LUKE,I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.,IV
274,BEN,That's your uncle talking.,IV
275,LUKE,"Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?",IV
276,BEN,"Learn about the Force, Luke.",IV
277,LUKE,"Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.",IV
278,BEN,"You must do what you feel is right, of course.",IV
279,TAGGE,Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize.,IV
280,MOTTI,"Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!",IV
281,TAGGE,The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....,IV
282,TARKIN,The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.  I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.  The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.,IV
283,TAGGE,That's impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?,IV
284,TARKIN,The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.,IV
285,TAGGE,"And what of the Rebellion?  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.",IV
286,VADER,The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.,IV
287,MOTTI,"Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it!",IV
288,VADER,Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.,IV
289,MOTTI,"Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...",IV
290,VADER,I find your lack of faith disturbing.,IV
291,TARKIN,"Enough of this!  Vader, release him!",IV
292,VADER,As you wish.,IV
293,TARKIN,This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.,IV
294,LUKE,"It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.",IV
295,BEN,They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.,IV
296,LUKE,These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.,IV
297,BEN,"And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.",IV
298,LUKE,Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?,IV
299,LUKE,"If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!",IV
300,BEN,"Wait, Luke!  It's too dangerous.",IV
301,LUKE,Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!,IV
302,VADER,"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.",IV
303,BEN,"There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.  You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.",IV
304,LUKE,I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.,IV
305,BEN,Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.,IV
306,TROOPER,How long have you had these droids?,IV
307,LUKE,About three or four seasons.,IV
308,BEN,They're for sale if you want them.,IV
309,TROOPER,Let me see your identification.,IV
310,BEN,You don't need to see his identification.,IV
311,TROOPER,We don't need to see his identification.,IV
312,BEN,looking for.,IV
313,TROOPER,These are not the droids we're looking for.,IV
314,BEN,He can go about his business.,IV
315,TROOPER,You can go about your business.,IV
316,BEN,Move along.,IV
317,TROOPER,Move along.  Move along.,IV
318,THREEPIO,I can't abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.,IV
319,LUKE,"Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.",IV
320,BEN,The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.,IV
321,LUKE,Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?,IV
322,BEN,"Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.",IV
323,LUKE,I'm ready for anything.,IV
324,THREEPIO,"Come along, Artoo.",IV
325,BARTENDER,We don't serve their kind here!,IV
326,LUKE,What?,IV
327,BARTENDER,Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.,IV
328,LUKE,"Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.",IV
329,THREEPIO,I heartily agree with you sir.,IV
330,CREATURE,Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?,IV
331,HUMAN,He doesn't like you.,IV
332,LUKE,I'm sorry.,IV
333,HUMAN,I don't like you either,IV
334,HUMAN,Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.,IV
335,LUKE,I'll be careful than.,IV
336,HUMAN,You'll be dead.,IV
337,BEN,This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...,IV
338,BARTENDER,No blasters!  No blaster!,IV
339,BEN,This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.,IV
340,THREEPIO,I don't like the look of this.,IV
341,HAN,Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.,IV
342,BEN,"Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.",IV
343,HAN,Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?,IV
344,BEN,Should I have?,IV
345,HAN,It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!,IV
346,HAN,"I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?",IV
347,BEN,"Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.",IV
348,HAN,What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?,IV
349,BEN,Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.,IV
350,HAN,"Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.",IV
351,LUKE,Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!,IV
352,HAN,"But who's going to fly it, kid!  You?",IV
353,LUKE,You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...,IV
354,BEN,"We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.",IV
355,HAN,"Seventeen, huh!",IV
356,HAN,Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.,IV
357,BEN,Ninety-four.,IV
358,HAN,Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.,IV
359,TROOPER,"All right, we'll check it out.",IV
360,HAN,Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.,IV
361,BEN,You'll have to sell your speeder.,IV
362,LUKE,That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.,IV
363,GREEDO,"Going somewhere, Solo?",IV
364,HAN,"Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.",IV
365,GREEDO,"It's too late.  You should have paid him when you had the chance.  Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.  I'm lucky I found you first.",IV
366,HAN,"Yeah, but this time I got the money.",IV
367,GREEDO,"If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.",IV
368,HAN,I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...,IV
369,GREEDO,Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.,IV
370,HAN,Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?,IV
371,GREEDO,You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.,IV
372,HAN,Over my dead body.,IV
373,GREEDO,That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.,IV
374,HAN,"Yes, I'll bet you have.",IV
375,HAN,Sorry about the mess.,IV
376,VADER,Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.,IV
377,IMPERIAL,"OFFICER"" ""The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?",IV
378,TARKIN,Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.,IV
379,VADER,What do you mean?,IV
380,TARKIN,I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.,IV
381,TROOPER,With pleasure.,IV
382,THREEPIO,"Lock the door, Artoo.",IV
383,TROOPER,"All right, check that side of the street.  It's secure.  Move on to the next door.",IV
384,THREEPIO,"I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.",IV
385,THREEPIO,You watch your language!,IV
386,LUKE,"He says it's the best he can do.  Since the XP-38 came out, they ",IV
387,BEN,It will be enough.,IV
388,BEN,"If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.",IV
389,JABBA,"Come on out, Solo!",IV
390,HAN,"I've been waiting for you, Jabba.",IV
391,JABBA,I expected you would be.,IV
392,HAN,I'm not the type to run.,IV
393,JABBA,"Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.",IV
394,HAN,You sent Greedo to blast me.,IV
395,JABBA,"Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.",IV
396,HAN,"I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.",IV
397,JABBA,"Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.",IV
398,HAN,"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.",IV
399,JABBA,"Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.",IV
400,HAN,"Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.",IV
401,LUKE,What a piece of junk.,IV
402,HAN,"She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.  I've added some special modifications myself.",IV
403,HAN,"We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.",IV
404,THREEPIO,"Hello, sir.",IV
405,TROOPER,Which way?,IV
406,TROOPER,"All right, men.  Load your weapons!",IV
407,TROOPER,Stop that ship!,IV
408,TROOPER,Blast 'em!,IV
409,HAN,"Chewie, get us out of here!",IV
410,THREEPIO,"Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.",IV
411,HAN,It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.,IV
412,HAN,Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.,IV
413,LUKE,Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.,IV
414,HAN,"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!",IV
415,HAN,Here's where the fun begins!,IV
416,BEN,How long before you can make the jump to light speed?,IV
417,HAN,It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.,IV
418,LUKE,Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...,IV
419,HAN,"Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?",IV
420,LUKE,What's that flashing?,IV
421,HAN,"We're losing our deflector shield.  Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.",IV
422,MOTTI,We've entered the Alderaan system.,IV
423,LEIA,"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.",IV
424,TARKIN,Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!,IV
425,LEIA,to take the responsibility yourself!,IV
426,TARKIN,"Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.",IV
427,LEIA,"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.",IV
428,TARKIN,"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.",IV
429,LEIA,No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...,IV
430,TARKIN,You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!,IV
431,TARKIN,I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?,IV
432,LEIA,Dantooine.,IV
433,LEIA,They're on Dantooine.,IV
434,TARKIN,"There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.",IV
435,LEIA,What?,IV
436,TARKIN,You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. ,IV
437,LEIA,No!,IV
438,VADER,Commence primary ignition.,IV
439,LUKE,Are you all right?  What's wrong?,IV
440,BEN,I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.,IV
441,BEN,You'd better get on with your exercises.,IV
442,HAN,"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.",IV
443,HAN,Don't everyone thank me at once.,IV
444,HAN,"Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.",IV
445,THREEPIO,"Now be careful, Artoo.",IV
446,THREEPIO,He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.,IV
447,HAN,Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.,IV
448,THREEPIO,"But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.",IV
449,HAN,That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.,IV
450,THREEPIO,"I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.",IV
451,BEN,"Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.",IV
452,LUKE,You mean it controls your actions?,IV
453,BEN,Partially. But it also obeys your commands.,IV
454,HAN,"Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.",IV
455,LUKE,"You don't believe in the Force, do you?",IV
456,HAN,"Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.  There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.",IV
457,HAN,It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.,IV
458,BEN,"I suggest you try it again, Luke.",IV
459,BEN,"This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.",IV
460,LUKE,"With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?",IV
461,BEN,Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them.,IV
462,BEN,Stretch out with your feelings.,IV
463,BEN,"You see, you can do it.",IV
464,HAN,I call it luck. ,IV
465,BEN,"In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.",IV
466,HAN,"Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else.",IV
467,HAN,Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.,IV
468,LUKE,"You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote.",IV
469,BEN,That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.,IV
470,TARKIN,Yes.,IV
471,OFFICER,"CASS"" ""Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.",IV
472,TARKIN,She lied!  She lied to us!,IV
473,VADER,I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.,IV
474,TARKIN,Terminate her... immediately!,IV
475,HAN,"Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.",IV
476,HAN,"What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  It's not on any of the charts.",IV
477,LUKE,What's going on?,IV
478,HAN,"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!",IV
479,LUKE,What do you mean?  Where is it?,IV
480,HAN,"Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.",IV
481,LUKE,What?  How?,IV
482,BEN,Destroyed... by the Empire!,IV
483,HAN,The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...,IV
484,HAN,There's another ship coming in.,IV
485,LUKE,Maybe they know what happened.,IV
486,BEN,It's an Imperial fighter.,IV
487,LUKE,It followed us!,IV
488,BEN,No.  It's a short range fighter.,IV
489,HAN,There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?,IV
490,LUKE,"It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble.",IV
491,HAN,Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.,IV
492,BEN,It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.,IV
493,HAN,Not for long...,IV
494,BEN,A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.,IV
495,LUKE,"Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...",IV
496,HAN,"Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.",IV
497,LUKE,Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.,IV
498,HAN,I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.,IV
499,BEN,That's no moon!  It's a space station.,IV
500,HAN,It's too big to be a space station.,IV
501,LUKE,I have a very bad feeling about this.,IV
502,BEN,Turn the ship around!,IV
503,HAN,"Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.",IV
504,LUKE,Why are we still moving towards it?,IV
505,HAN,We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!,IV
506,LUKE,But there's gotta be something you can do!,IV
507,HAN,"There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!",IV

535,THREEPIO,"We found the computer outlet, sir.",IV
536,BEN,Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.,IV
537,THREEPIO,He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.,IV
538,THREEPIO,The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.  A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.,IV
539,BEN,I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.,IV
540,HAN,Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.,IV

544,BEN,They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you... always!,IV

558,LUKE,Where... where is she?,IV
559,HAN,Princess?  What's going on?,IV
560,THREEPIO,Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.,IV
561,LUKE,"Oh, no!  We've got to do something.",IV
562,HAN,What are you talking about?,IV
563,LUKE,The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.,IV
564,HAN,"Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.",IV
565,LUKE,"But he didn't know she was here.  Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?",IV
566,HAN,I'm not going anywhere.,IV

572,HAN,Rich?,IV
573,LUKE,"Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...",IV
574,HAN,What?,IV
575,LUKE,Well more wealth that you can imagine.,IV
576,HAN,"I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!",IV
577,LUKE,You'll get it!,IV
578,HAN,I better!,IV
579,LUKE,You will...,IV
580,HAN,"All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!",IV
581,LUKE,All right.,IV
582,HAN,What's your plan?,IV

599,LUKE,He's going to pull us all apart.,IV
600,HAN,Go get him!,IV
601,HAN,We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.  Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.  You go get her.  I'll hold them here.,IV

541,THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far.  No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?",V
542,HAN,The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand  by the manual release for the landing claw.,V
543,THREEPIO,I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a  perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...,V
544,HAN,Thank you.,V
545,LEIA,What did you have in mind for your next move?,V
546,HAN,"Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump  their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.",V
547,LEIA,With the rest of the garbage. Then what?,V
548,HAN,Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any  ideas?,V
549,LEIA,No. Where are we?,V
550,HAN,The Anoat system.,V
551,LEIA,Anoat system. There's not much there.,V
552,HAN,"No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.",V
553,LEIA,Lando system?,V
554,HAN,"Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card  player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.",V
555,LEIA,Thanks.,V
556,HAN,"Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.",V
557,LEIA,A mining colony?,V
558,HAN,"Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go  back a long way, Lando and me.",V
559,LEIA,Can you trust him?,V
560,HAN,"No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that.",V

565,YODA,"Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.",V
566,LUKE,I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.,V
567,YODA,Mmm. Friends you have there.,V
568,LUKE,They were in pain.,V
569,YODA,It is the future you see.,V
570,LUKE,Future? Will they die?,V
571,YODA,Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.,V
572,LUKE,I've got to go to them.,V
573,YODA,"Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help  them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.",V

575,HAN,Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.,V
576,INTERCOM,"VOICE"" ""You will not deviate from your present course.",V
577,THREEPIO,"Rather touchy, aren't they?",V
578,LEIA,I thought you knew this person.,V

580,INTERCOM,"VOICE"" ""Permission granted to land on Platform  Three-two-seven.",V
581,HAN,Thank you.,V
582,HAN,"There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.",V

584,THREEPIO,Oh. No one to meet us.,V
585,LEIA,I don't like this.,V
586,HAN,"Well, what would you like?",V
587,THREEPIO,"Well, they did let us land.",V
588,HAN,"Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me.",V
589,HAN,"See? My friend.  Keep your eyes open, okay?",V
590,LANDO,"Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a  lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled.",V
591,LANDO,"How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! I  never thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?",V
592,THREEPIO,"Well, he seems very friendly.",V
593,LEIA,Yes...very friendly.,V
594,LANDO,What are you doing here?,V
595,HAN,Ahh...repairs. I thought you could  help me out.,V
596,LANDO,What have you done to my ship?,V
597,HAN,"Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.",V
598,LANDO,Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm  the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?,V
599,LEIA,Leia.,V
600,LANDO,"Welcome, Leia.",V
601,HAN,"All right, all right, you old smoothie.",V
602,THREEPIO,"Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My  facilities are at your...",V
603,THREEPIO,"Well, really!",V
604,LANDO,What's wrong with the Falcon?,V
605,HAN,Hyperdrive.,V
606,LANDO,I'll get my people to work on it.,V
607,HAN,Good.,V
608,LANDO,"You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the  fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.",V
609,HAN,How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?,V
610,LANDO,"Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very  self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny?",V
611,HAN,"You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible  leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?",V
612,LANDO,"You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things.",V
613,HAN,Yeah.,V
614,LANDO,"Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the  price you pay for being successful.",V
615,THREEPIO,Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.,V
616,SECOND,"THREEPIO"" ""E chu ta!",V
617,THREEPIO,How rude!,V

620,MAN,Who are you?,V
621,THREEPIO,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No,  no, please don't get up. No!",V
622,YODA,Luke! You must complete the training.,V
623,LUKE,I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've  got to help them.,V
624,YODA,You must not go!,V
625,LUKE,But Han and Leia will die if I don't.,V
626,BEN,You don't know that.,V
627,BEN,Even Yoda cannot see their fate.,V
628,LUKE,But I can help them! I feel the Force!,V
629,BEN,"But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when  you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.",V
630,YODA,"Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure  at the cave!",V
631,LUKE,"But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to  return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.",V
632,BEN,It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your  friends are made to suffer.,V
633,LUKE,And that is why I have to go.,V
634,BEN,"Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost  Vader.",V
635,LUKE,You won't.,V
636,YODA,"Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi  Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.",V
637,BEN,Patience.,V
638,LUKE,And sacrifice Han and Leia?,V
639,YODA,If you honor what they fight for...yes!,V
640,BEN,"If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot  interfere.",V
641,LUKE,"I understand.  Artoo, fire up the  converters.",V
642,BEN,"Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side.",V
643,YODA,Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.,V
644,LUKE,I will. And I'll return. I promise.,V
645,YODA,"Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.",V
646,BEN,That boy is our last hope.,V
647,YODA,No. There is another.,V
648,HAN,The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're  in great shape.,V
649,LEIA,The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen  or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.,V
650,HAN,Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.,V
651,LEIA,I don't trust Lando.,V
652,HAN,"Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides,  we'll soon be gone.",V
653,LEIA,"And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?",V
654,LEIA,What happened?,V
655,HAN,Where? Found him in a junk pile?,V
656,LEIA,"Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?",V
657,HAN,Lando's got people who can fix him.,V
658,LEIA,"No, thanks.",V
659,LANDO,I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?,V
660,LEIA,Not really.,V
661,LANDO,You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us  among the clouds.,V
662,LEIA,Thank you.,V
663,LANDO,Will you join me for a little refreshment?,V
664,LANDO,"Everyone's invited, of course.",V
665,LANDO,Having trouble with you droid?,V
666,HAN,No. No problem. Why?,V
667,LANDO,"So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into  the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire.",V
668,LEIA,So you're part of the mining guild then?,V
669,LANDO,"No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be  noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.",V
670,HAN,Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down?,V
671,LANDO,That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.,V
672,VADER,We would be honored if you would join us.,V
673,LANDO,I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.,V
674,HAN,"I'm sorry, too.",V
675,LUKE,"No, Threepio's with them.",V
676,LUKE,Just hang on. We're almost there.,V
677,THREEPIO,"Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take this off! I, uh, don't mean  to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No!",V
678,THREEPIO,"Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the  others. Oh, no! I've been shot!",V
679,LANDO,Lord Vader.,V
680,VADER,You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I  have Skywalker.,V
681,BOBA,"FETT"" ""He's no good to me dead.",V
682,VADER,He will not be permanently damaged.,V
683,LANDO,"Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?",V
684,VADER,They must never again leave this city.,V
685,LANDO,"That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han  to this bounty hunter!",V
686,VADER,Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.,V
687,LANDO,No.,V
688,VADER,Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison  here.,V
689,LANDO,This deal's getting worse all the time.,V
690,THREEPIO,"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not  right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...",V
691,HAN,I feel terrible.,V
692,LEIA,Why are they doing this?,V
693,HAN,They never even asked me any questions.,V
694,LEIA,Lando.,V
695,HAN,"Get out of here, Lando!",V
696,LANDO,Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie  over to me.,V
697,HAN,Over to you?,V
698,LANDO,"They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.",V
699,LEIA,What about Han?,V
700,LANDO,Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.,V
701,LEIA,Vader wants us all dead.,V
702,LANDO,He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called  Skywalker.,V
703,HAN,Luke?,V
704,LANDO,Lord Vader has set a trap for him.,V
705,LEIA,And we're the bait.,V
706,LANDO,"Well, he's on his way.",V
707,HAN,"Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?   My friend!",V
708,LANDO,"Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better,  but I have my own problems.",V
709,HAN,"Yeah, you're a real hero.",V
710,LEIA,You certainly have a way with people.,V
711,VADER,"This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze  Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.",V
712,IMPERIAL,"SOLDIER"" ""Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class.",V
713,VADER,Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.,V
714,LANDO,"Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If  you put him in there, it might kill him.",V
715,VADER,I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on  Captain Solo.,V
716,THREEPIO,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this  ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish.",V
717,HAN,What's going on...buddy?,V
718,LANDO,You're being put into carbon freeze.,V
719,BOBA,"FETT"" ""What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.",V
720,VADER,The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!,V

722,HAN,"Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!",V
723,THREEPIO,"Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.",V
724,HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!",V
725,HAN,Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you  have to take care of her. You hear me?,V
726,LEIA,I love you!,V
727,HAN,I know.,V
728,THREEPIO,"What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see.  Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is.",V
729,VADER,"Well, Calrissian, did he survive?",V
730,LANDO,"Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation.",V
731,VADER,He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.,V
732,IMPERIAL,"OFFICER"" ""Skywalker has just landed, my lord.",V

735,VADER,I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.,V

737,VADER,"The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi  yet.",V
738,LANDO,Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it  quiet. Move.,V
739,LEIA,What do you think you're doing?,V
740,LANDO,We're getting out of here.,V
741,THREEPIO,I knew all along it had to be a mistake.,V
742,LEIA,Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust  you?,V
743,LANDO,I had no choice...,V
744,THREEPIO,"What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!",V
745,LEIA,"Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.",V
746,LANDO,I'm just trying to help...,V
747,LEIA,We don't need any of your help.,V
748,LANDO,H-a-a-a...,V

763,VADER,All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor  thought.,V
764,VADER,Impressive...most impressive.,V
765,VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear...  now release your anger.,V
766,VADER,Only your hatred can destroy me.,V
767,LANDO,The security codes has been changed!,V
768,THREEPIO,"Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security  system.",V
769,LANDO,Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes  control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.,V
770,LANDO,This way.,V
771,THREEPIO,Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know  a power socket from a computer terminal.,V

9,JERJERROD,"I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.",VI
10,VADER,The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.,VI
11,JERJERROD,But he asks the impossible. I need more men.,VI

19,THREEPIO,"Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.",VI
20,THREEPIO,There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.,VI
21,STRANGE,"VOICE"" ""Tee chuta hhat yudd!",VI
22,THREEPIO,Goodness gracious me!,VI
23,THREEPIO,Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.,VI
24,THREEPIO,"I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.",VI
25,THREEPIO,"Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this.",VI
26,THREEPIO,"Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!",VI
27,THREEPIO,"Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.",VI
28,BIB,Die Wanna Wanga!,VI
29,THREEPIO,"Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt.",VI
30,THREEPIO,"... and a gift.  Gift, what gift?",VI
31,BIB,Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.,VI
32,THREEPIO,He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.,VI
33,THREEPIO,I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.,VI
34,BIB,Nudd Chaa.,VI
35,THREEPIO,"Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.",VI
36,THREEPIO,Good morning.,VI
37,JABBA,Bo Shuda!,VI
38,THREEPIO,"The message, Artoo, the message.",VI
39,LUKE,"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life.  With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.",VI
40,THREEPIO,What did he say?,VI
41,LUKE,... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.,VI
42,THREEPIO,"This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.",VI
43,JABBA,There will be no bargain.,VI
44,THREEPIO,We're doomed.,VI
45,JABBA,I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.,VI
46,THREEPIO,"Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.",VI
47,THREEPIO,What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!,VI
48,NINEDENINE,"Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?",VI
49,THREEPIO,"I am See-Threepio, human-cy...",VI
50,NINEDENINE,Yes or no will do.,VI
51,THREEPIO,"Oh. Well, yes.",VI
52,NINEDENINE,How many languages do you speak?,VI
53,THREEPIO,"I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...",VI
54,NINEDENINE,Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.,VI
55,THREEPIO,Disintegrated?,VI
56,NINEDENINE,Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.,VI
57,THREEPIO,"Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!",VI
58,NINEDENINE,"You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely.",VI
59,JABBA,Da Eitha!,VI
60,OOLA,Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...,VI
61,JABBA,Boscka!,VI
62,BOUSHH,I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.,VI
63,THREEPIO,"Oh, no! Chewbacca!",VI
64,JABBA,At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.,VI
65,THREEPIO,"Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!",VI
66,THREEPIO,Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty- five thousand.,VI
67,BOUSHH,I want fifty thousand. No less.,VI
68,THREEPIO,"Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?  Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.",VI
69,THREEPIO,Because he's holding a thermal detonator.,VI
70,JABBA,This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.,VI
71,THREEPIO,Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.,VI
72,BOUSHH,Zeebuss.,VI
73,THREEPIO,He agrees!,VI
74,BOUSHH,Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.,VI
75,BOUSHH,Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.,VI
76,HAN,I can't see.,VI
77,BOUSHH,You eyesight will return in time.,VI
78,HAN,Where am I?,VI
79,BOUSHH,Jabba's palace.,VI
80,HAN,Who are you?,VI
81,LEIA,Someone who loves you.,VI
82,HAN,Leia!,VI
83,LEIA,I gotta get you out of here.,VI
84,HAN,What's that? I know that laugh.,VI
85,HAN,"Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.",VI
86,JABBA,"It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder.",VI
87,HAN,Look...,VI
88,JABBA,Take him away!,VI
89,HAN,Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!,VI
90,JABBA,Bring her to me.,VI
91,LEIA,We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...,VI
92,JABBA,I'm sure.,VI
93,LEIA,Ugh!,VI
94,THREEPIO,"Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.",VI
95,HAN,"Chewie? Chewie, is that you?",VI
96,HAN,Ah! Chew--Chewie!,VI
97,HAN,"Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?",VI
98,HAN,"Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.",VI
99,HAN,"A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.",VI
100,HAN,"I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.",VI
101,LUKE,I must speak with Jabba.,VI
102,LUKE,You will take me to Jabba now!,VI
103,LUKE,You serve your master well.,VI
104,LUKE,And you will be rewarded.,VI
105,THREEPIO,At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.,VI
106,BIB,Master.,VI
107,BIB,"...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.",VI
108,JABBA,I told you not to admit him.,VI
109,LUKE,I must be allowed to speak.,VI
110,BIB,He must be allowed to speak.,VI
111,JABBA,You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.,VI
112,LUKE,You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.,VI
113,JABBA,"Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.",VI
114,LUKE,"Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.",VI
115,THREEPIO,"Master Luke, you're standing on...",VI
116,JABBA,"There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.",VI
117,JABBA,Bascka!,VI
118,THREEPIO,"Oh, no! The Rancor!",VI
119,JABBA,Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.,VI
120,LUKE,Han!,VI
121,HAN,Luke!,VI
122,LUKE,Are you all right?,VI
123,HAN,"Fine. Together again, huh?",VI
124,LUKE,Wouldn't miss it.,VI
125,HAN,How are we doing?,VI
126,LUKE,The same as always.,VI
127,HAN,"That bad, huh? Where's Leia?",VI
128,LEIA,I'm here.,VI
129,THREEPIO,"Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.",VI
130,HAN,"Good, I hate long waits.",VI
131,THREEPIO,"You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.",VI
132,HAN,Doesn't sound so bad.,VI
133,THREEPIO,"In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.",VI
134,HAN,"On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?",VI
135,LUKE,"You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.",VI
136,HAN,"I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.",VI
137,LUKE,"There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.",VI
138,HAN,"You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.",VI
139,LUKE,Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.,VI
140,HAN,Oh... great!,VI
141,JABBA,Soon you will learn to appreciate me.,VI
142,THREEPIO,"Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?",VI
143,THREEPIO,"Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!",VI
144,THREEPIO,Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.,VI
145,THREEPIO,"Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.",VI
146,HAN,"Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?",VI
147,LUKE,Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.,VI
148,JABBA,Move him into position.,VI
149,JABBA,Put him in.,VI
150,LUKE,"Easy, Chewie.",VI
151,LANDO,Whoa! Whoa! Help!,VI
152,HAN,"Chewie, you okay? Where is he?",VI
153,HAN,"I'm okay, pal.",VI
154,LANDO,Han! Chewie?,VI
155,HAN,Lando!,VI
156,HAN,Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?,VI
157,HAN,"Lando, grab it!",VI
158,LANDO,Lower it!,VI
159,HAN,I'm trying!,VI
160,HAN,"Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.",VI
161,HAN,Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!,VI
162,HAN,Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!,VI
163,LANDO,Hold it! Whoa!,VI
164,HAN,"Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.",VI
165,HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.",VI
166,LANDO,"No, wait! I thought you were blind!",VI
167,HAN,It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.,VI
168,LANDO,All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!,VI
169,HAN,"Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!",VI
170,LEIA,Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.,VI
171,THREEPIO,"Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!",VI
172,LUKE,Get the gun! Point it at the deck!,VI
173,LUKE,Point it at the deck!,VI
174,THREEPIO,"Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.",VI
175,LUKE,Come on!,VI
176,LUKE,Let's go! And don't forget the droids.,VI
177,LANDO,We're on our way.,VI
178,HAN,I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!,VI
179,LEIA,That's all any of us can see.,VI
180,HAN,Then I guess I'm getting better.,VI
181,HAN,"I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.",VI
182,LUKE,I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.,VI
183,HAN,"No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!",VI
184,LUKE,I'll see you back at the fleet.,VI
185,HAN,Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?,VI
186,LUKE,I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.,VI
187,HAN,"Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.",VI
188,LANDO,"Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.",VI
189,LEIA,"He means \""You're welcome.\",VI
190,LANDO,"Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.",VI
191,LUKE,I'll meet you back at the fleet.,VI
192,LEIA,Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.,VI
193,LUKE,I will.,VI
194,HAN,"Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.",VI
195,LUKE,"That's right, Artoo. We're going to the  Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep...  to an old friend.",VI
196,EMPEROR,"Rise, my friend.",VI
197,VADER,The Death Star will be completed on schedule.,VI
198,EMPEROR,"You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.",VI
199,VADER,"Yes, my Master.",VI
200,EMPEROR,"Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.",VI
201,VADER,As you wish.,VI
202,EMPEROR,Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.,VI
203,YODA,Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?,VI
204,LUKE,No... of course not.,VI
205,YODA,"I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak.  When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?",VI
206,YODA,"Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.",VI
207,LUKE,"Master Yoda, you can't die.",VI
208,YODA,Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.,VI
209,LUKE,But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.,VI
210,YODA,No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.,VI
211,LUKE,Then I am a Jedi?,VI
212,YODA,"Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.",VI
213,LUKE,Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?,VI
214,YODA,Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.,VI
215,LUKE,"Yoda, I must know.",VI
216,YODA,Your father he is.,VI
217,YODA,"Told you, did he?",VI
218,LUKE,Yes.,VI
219,YODA,"Unexpected this is, and unfortunate..",VI
220,LUKE,Unfortunate that I know the truth?,VI
221,YODA,No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.,VI
222,LUKE,"Well, I'm sorry.",VI
223,YODA,"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.",VI
224,YODA,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I , the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...  There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker.",VI
225,LUKE,"I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.",VI
226,BEN,Yoda will always be with you.,VI
227,LUKE,Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?,VI
228,LUKE,You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.,VI
229,BEN,"You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.",VI
230,LUKE,A certain point of view!,VI
231,BEN,"Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.",VI
232,BEN,"I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault.",VI
233,BEN,Anakin was a good friend.,VI
234,BEN,"When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.",VI
235,LUKE,There's still good in him.,VI
236,BEN,I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.,VI
237,LUKE,"I can't do it, Ben.",VI
238,BEN,You cannot escape your destiny.,VI
239,LUKE,I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.,VI
240,BEN,"Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.",VI
241,LUKE,But I had to help my friends.,VI
242,BEN,"And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.",VI
243,LUKE,I found out Darth Vader was my father.,VI
244,BEN,"To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!",VI
245,LUKE,I can't kill my own father.,VI
246,BEN,Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.,VI
247,LUKE,Yoda spoke of another.,VI
248,BEN,The other he spoke of is your twin sister.,VI
249,LUKE,But I have no sister.,VI
250,BEN,"Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.",VI
251,LUKE,Leia! Leia's my sister.,VI
252,BEN,"Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.",VI
253,BEN,"When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.",VI
254,BEN,"The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.",VI
255,LUKE,"But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.",VI
256,BEN,"She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!",VI
257,HAN,"Well, look at you, a general, huh?",VI
258,LANDO,"Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.",VI
259,HAN,"Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.",VI
260,LANDO,I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.,VI
261,HAN,"Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?",VI
262,MON,"MOTHMA"" ""The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.",VI
263,MON,"MOTHMA"" ""The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.",VI
264,MON,"MOTHMA"" ""Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.",VI
265,ACKBAR,"You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.",VI
266,ACKBAR,General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack,VI
267,HAN,Good luck.,VI
268,HAN,You're gonna need it.,VI
269,ACKBAR,General Madine.,VI
270,GENERAL,"MADINE"" ""We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.",VI
271,THREEPIO,Sounds dangerous.,VI

273,GENERAL,"MADINE"" ""General Solo, is your strike team assembled?",VI
274,HAN,"Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.",VI
275,HAN,"Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.",VI
276,HAN,That's one.,VI
277,LEIA,"Uh, General... count me in.",VI
278,VOICE,"I'm with you, too!",VI
279,LEIA,What is it?,VI
280,LUKE,Ask me again sometime.,VI
281,HAN,Luke.,VI
282,LUKE,"Hi, Han... Chewie.",VI
283,THREEPIO,"\""Exciting\"" is hardly the word I would use.",VI
284,HAN,Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.,VI
285,LANDO,"All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?",VI
286,HAN,Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.,VI
287,LANDO,"Look, would you get going, you pirate.",VI
288,LANDO,Good luck.,VI
289,HAN,"You, too.",VI
290,HAN,You got her warmed?,VI
291,LUKE,"Yeah, she's comin' up.",VI
292,HAN,"No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.",VI
293,LEIA,"Hey, are you awake?",VI
294,HAN,"Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.",VI
295,LEIA,"Come on, General, let's move.",VI
296,HAN,"Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?",VI
297,LUKE,All set.,VI
298,THREEPIO,Here we go again.,VI
299,HAN,"All right, hang on.",VI
300,VADER,"What is thy bidding, my Master?",VI
301,EMPEROR,Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.,VI
302,VADER,What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?,VI
303,EMPEROR,"It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.",VI
304,VADER,"Yes, my Master.",VI
305,HAN,"If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.",VI
306,CONTROLLER,We have you on our screen now. Please identify.,VI

308,CONTROLLER,"Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.",VI
309,HAN,Transmission commencing.,VI
310,LEIA,Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.,VI
311,HAN,It'll work. It'll work.,VI
312,LUKE,Vader's on that ship.,VI
313,HAN,"Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.",VI
314,HAN,I don't know.  Fly casual.,VI
315,LUKE,I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.,VI

440,LEIA,"Just...images, really. Feelings.",VI
441,LUKE,Tell me.,VI
442,LEIA,"She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?",VI

445,LUKE,"Vader is here...now, on this moon.",VI
446,LEIA,How do you know?,VI
447,LUKE,"I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go.  As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.  I have to face him.",VI
448,LEIA,Why?,VI
449,LUKE,He's my father.,VI
450,LEIA,Your father?,VI
451,LUKE,"There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.",VI
452,LEIA,"Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.",VI
453,LUKE,"You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.",VI
454,LUKE,Yes. It's you Leia.,VI
455,LEIA,I know. Somehow...I've always known.,VI
456,LUKE,Then you know why I have to face him.,VI
457,LEIA,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.",VI
458,LUKE,"No, you don't. You've always been strong.",VI
459,LEIA,"But, why must you confront him?",VI
460,LUKE,Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.,VI
461,HAN,"Hey, what's goin' on?",VI
462,LEIA,Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.,VI
463,HAN,"Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?",VI
464,LEIA,I...I can't tell you.,VI
465,HAN,Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?,VI
466,LEIA,I...,VI
467,HAN,Ahhh...,VI
468,HAN,I'm sorry.,VI
469,LEIA,Hold me.,VI
470,COMMANDER,"This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area.",VI

477,LUKE,"I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.",VI
478,VADER,That name no longer has any meaning for me.,VI
479,LUKE,It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.,VI
480,VADER,I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.,VI
481,VADER,"Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.",VI
482,LUKE,Come with me.,VI
483,VADER,Obi-Wan once thought as you do.,VI
484,VADER,You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.,VI
485,LUKE,I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.,VI
486,VADER,If that is your destiny.,VI
487,LUKE,"Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.",VI
488,VADER,"It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.",VI
489,LUKE,Then my father is truly dead.,VI
490,LEIA,The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.,VI
491,HAN,"Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.",VI
492,LEIA,What's he saying?,VI
493,THREEPIO,He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.,VI

502,HAN,Then we'll do it real quiet-like.,VI
503,THREEPIO,"Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!",VI
504,LEIA,Quiet.,VI
505,THREEPIO,I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.,VI

508,SCOUT,Look! Over there! Stop him!,VI
509,HAN,Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.,VI

514,EMPEROR,I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master.,VI
515,LUKE,You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.,VI
516,EMPEROR,"Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.",VI
517,VADER,His lightsaber.,VI
518,EMPEROR,"Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you.",VI
519,LUKE,You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.,VI
520,EMPEROR,Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.,VI
521,EMPEROR,Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.,VI
522,LUKE,Your overconfidence is your weakness.,VI
523,EMPEROR,Your faith in your friends is yours.,VI
524,VADER,"It is pointless to resist, my son.",VI
525,EMPEROR,Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design.  Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...,VI
526,EMPEROR,...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.,VI
